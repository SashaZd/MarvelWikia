This and other factors led to the family to scatter around the globe, adopting the so-called \"Relative Strangers Protocol\". The family feared that should their existence become public, they would face undue persecution and hardship. Cuckoo adopted the identity of the head of an exclusive fashion design company.\n\nEventually, the existence of the family was discovered and the members began to be systematically murdered. Kay was one of the first killed, but she used her [[Glossary:P#psychic|psychic]] abilities to find a recently accosted prostitute and took over her dead body. Cuckoo was instrumental in coordinating the other family members into defeated their enemies, and in staying together as a family once again.\n\nKay used her psychic abilities to convince her co-workers that her new body was the heir to Kay's fortune, and she assumed control of Kay Cera's fashion designs once again. This led to an assassination attempt on herself, but this was stopped by her family members, [[Crimson Crusader|Rory]] and [[Imp|Pandora]], with [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] in tow.\n\nWhen the demon Synraith tried to enter [[Earth]]'s [[Glossary:D#dimension|dimension]], it drew Cuckoo and the others responsible for its containment (including Professor X) together again. A brief misunderstanding allowed the two families of X-Men and [[ClanDestine]] to scuffle, but soon the demon was defeated, killed as the heroes closed its dimensional gate.",
