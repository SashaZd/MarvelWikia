X-Force teamed up with the New Warriors, whose member Firestar had also been captured, and together they opposed the organizer of the contest, the Gamesmaster. Paige secretly followed them and confronted the Gamesmaster, defeating him in a game of wits.\n\nSoon after, Paige was kidnapped by the techno-organic alien Phalanx, who sought to learn how to assimilate mutants into their collective. Paige and her fellow abductees were rescued by an ad-hoc X-Men team, and subsequently became founding members of Generation X, a team of mutants enrolled at the new Massachusetts branch of Xavier's School. During her time there, Paige studied to become a better X-Man than Sam. She also romanced her teammate Chamber. After the School was closed, Paige was recruited by her former headmaster Banshee into his paramilitary X-Corps. After that group was dismantled, Paige went to study at the reestablished Xavier Institute. Her interest in environmental issues led to her discovering corruption within Worthington Enterprises, the company owned by the X-Man [[Archangel]]. Investigating, she and [[Archangel]] encountered the Dominant Species, and she was almost killed. [[Archangel]] saved her with his healing ability, after which they became romantically involved.\n\nHaving finally graduated to the ranks of the X-Men, Paige later aided [[Archangel]] in establishing the global mutant outreach program \"Mutantes Sans Frontières.\" Setting up office in Zanzibar, they became involved in an attempt by the Hellfire Club to destabilize the country by employing the mercenary Weaponeers. Alongside the country's President, who was secretly the superhero Askari, as well as reinforcements from Genosha, the heroes managed to repel the invaders.\n\nDuring Selene's attack on the X Men during her creation of Necrosha, Husk and the New X Men fought against Synch and Skin who were alive through Eli Bard's Techo Organic Virus.  Husk was apart of Nightcrawler's away team to Muir Island with Blindfold, Rogue, Trance, Magneto, Colossus and Psylocke to face the re-animated Proteus.\n\nWhen Hope and Cable came back from the future, Paige was seen defending Utopia with the X-Men.",
