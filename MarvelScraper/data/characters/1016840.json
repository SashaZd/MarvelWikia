    "description": "A former street kid who’s not quite used to the Super Hero world, Luke is a no-nonsense tough guy who serves as the emotional heart and big brother of the group. He is fiercely loyal and nearly fearless in battle. \r\n\r\nLuke’s unbreakable skin and super strength make him the bruiser out of all the trainees. He’s the first guy to jump into a fight. However, he can still be hurt by concussive blasts and other forms of energy.\r\n\r\nAs Danny’s best friend, Luke is the translator for Danny’s sometimes spacey, non-sequitur comments. Luke will always be the first to defend Peter from others, both as civilians and Super Heroes.",
