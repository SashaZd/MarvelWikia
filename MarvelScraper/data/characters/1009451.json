Unfortunately, she grew arrogant, a trait reflected by her adoption of the name Moondragon after she seemingly destroyed the cosmic demon [[Dragon of the Moon]]. The Dragon secretly survived inside her, bolstering and feeding upon the darker aspects of her personality. \n\nThanos's assaults on Titan drove Moondragon to Earth where she allied herself with various heroes and joined the [[Avengers]]. Her questionable ethics and massive ego gradually estranged her from most of her peers whom she sometimes mentally manipulated. This culminated in Moondragon telepathically forcing the Avengers to aid in her \"benevolent\" conquest of the war-torn planet Ba-Banis, but the Avengers ultimately subdued her and turned her over to the [[Asgardians|Asgardian Gods]]. They placed her in the custody of the [[Defenders]], who helped her truly reform until the Dragon's growing influence turned her against them, resulting in the destruction of both Heather and the Dragon. Moondragon was resurrected by the Eternals and her cousin, Pam Douglas, who developed powers of her own and became [[Sundragon]]. Free of the Dragon's influence, Heather remains arrogant and self-righteous, but genuinely regrets her past misdeeds and wishes to be a force for good in the universe. \n\nMoondragon has been a mentor to [[Hellcat]], a benefactor to [[Jack of Hearts]] and a would-be lover of [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] (who did not share her feelings), though her machinations have estranged all of them to some extent. For a time, Heather wielded the cosmic [[Mind Gem]] as a member of [[Warlock, Adam|Adam Warlock]]'s [[Infinity Watch]] whose members also included [[Drax]], Heather's late father reborn in superhuman form; however, the Watch soon broke up, relinquishing their [[Infinity Gems]]. \n\nA friend and admirer of the late [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)]], Moondragon has acted as an ally and advisor to his son, Genis, the new [[Photon (Genis-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]. This led to a brief romance with [[Jones, Marlo Chandler|Marlo Chandler Jones]], wife of Genis's partner, [[Jones, Rick|Rick Jones]]; but the Joneses soon reconciled, and Moondragon resumed her travels alongside new love interest [[Quasar (Phyla-Vell)|Phyla]], Genis's sister.",
