X-23's natural healing also affords her virtual immunity to poisons and most drugs, as well as an enhanced resistance to diseases and the fatigue poisons generated by bodily activity. Hence, her endurance, agility and reflexes are enhanced. X-23 also possesses superhumanly acute senses, allowing her to see and hear things at an extended distance. She is able to recognize people and objects by scent, even if that person or object is hidden, and can use these enhanced senses to track any creature with an impressive degree of success.",

As a result, her claws are virtually unbreakable and are capable of cutting through almost any substance depending on its thickness and the amount of force she can exert.

As revenge for her insubordination, Rice forced Kinney to act as the surrogate mother for the clone, and she gave birth to \"X-23.\"\n\n\n[[image: x-2301.jpg|left|200px|thumb]]Raised in captivity, X-23 was trained to be a weapon. Kinney did her best to ensure the child retained some semblance of humanity, but her efforts appeared to be in vain. After seven years, Rice had X-23 subjected to radiation poisoning in order to accelerate the activation of her mutant gene, then forcibly extracted her claws and coated them with Adamantium. Next, Rice created a chemical compound he called \"trigger scent\" that sent X-23 into an involuntary berserker rage upon smelling its presence. Three years later, X-23 was sent on her first field mission to kill Presidential candidate Greg Johnson. Numerous other missions followed, as X-23's services were sold to the highest bidder, and she was left emotionally stunted as a result. Rice, in an attempt to avenge his father's murder, abandoned X-23 on a particularly dangerous mission, but she survived against overwhelming odds and managed to return to the facility.\n\nUltimately, Rice persuaded Sutter to hand over control of the program to him, then secretly ordered X-23 to kill Sutter and his family. Later, Rice revealed to Kinney a chamber with dozens of incubation pods containing female clones before he fired her. Before fleeing the facility with X-23, Kinney gave her one last mission - destroy the pods and kill Rice. However, Rice was able to exact revenge on Kinney from beyond the grave, as he had earlier exposed her to the trigger scent, sending X-23 into a rage that caused her to kill her mother. As she lay dying, Kinney named X-23 Laura.\n\n[[image: x-2302.jpg|left|200px|thumb]]X-23 surfaced in New York two years later and was found living on the streets by a pimp named [[Zebra Daddy]], who took her in and employed her as a prostitute. During her time as a prostitute, X-23 seemed to suffer from a self-mutilating disorder. She superficially cut herself with her own claws whenever she was in a threatening situation. She also seemed to suffer some personality issues which left her mostly mute and unable to free herself from the grip of Zebra Daddy. X-23 started to come to her senses after she met [[Nixon, Kiden|Kiden Nixon]], a young mutant with the ability to freeze [[Glossary:T#time|time]] when in danger, and together with Kiden's teacher, they rescued another young mutant, the feral [[Catiana]], from an angry mob. Zebra Daddy tracked X-23 down, but with the aid of her newfound friends and the mutant named [[Felon]], Zebra Daddy's thugs were defeated. X-23 then killed him to save the lives of her friends. X-23 later took a job at the mutant-themed Wannabee's nightclub in the [[Mutant Town]] district of New York. It was there that she saved the life of the daughter of mob boss Don Parisi from a gang of thugs, whom she killed. The deaths inadvertently implicated Wolverine, prompting his teammates in the [[X-Men]] to investigate. X-23 instinctually attacked Wolverine on sight, but he was eventually able to calm her down, and she led the X-Men to Parisi's daughter. After aiding the X-Men against Parisi's super-strong mutant enforcer [[Geech]], X-23 fled the scene. She later returned to help the X-Men save victims of a car accident, after which she was enrolled at the X-Men's [[Xavier Institute For Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]].\n\nX-23 quickly became very protective of Wolverine, attacking his teammate [[Bishop (Lucas Bishop)|Bishop]] after he felled Wolverine during a training session. She also took to observing Wolverine on the mansion's security monitors. During one such viewing, an anomalous energy spike prompted X-23 to investigate. Encountering [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] at the source of the signal, X-23 initially mistook him for an enemy and attacked. The pair ultimately teamed up to save the young mutant [[Patterson, Paul|Paul Patterson]] from an [[Glossary:A#Alternate Earth|alternate reality]] version of the armored [[Avengers|Avenger]] [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]]. The arrival of the heroic [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] and the super-spy [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] helped turn the tide. X-23 then secretly followed Wolverine on his investigation of strange activity in the Canadian Rockies. Ambushed by the Hauk'ka, evolved Saurians from the [[Savage Land]], X-23 managed to escape and alert the X-Men. Traveling to the Savage Land, X-23 and the X-Men teamed with the Land's lord [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]] and his circumstantial allies, the [[Savage Land Mutates]], to prevent the Hauk'ka from destroying human civilization by controlling the weather-manipulating X-Man [[Storm]].\n\nSometime later, X-23 turned up in the in two other X-titles, without her friends. She was accused of the murders of four [[Humans|humans]] that were investigated by Wolverine and his fellow X-Men. (While she was responsible for the murders, she committed them because the victims were brutally attacking a young woman.) After a brief conflict with the mutant [[Glossary:S#super hero|heroes]], X-23 came to live with them at the Xavier Institute. She has nearly no social skills, so Wolverine is helping her adjust to her new life. She seems to be making friends with [[Pryde, Kitty|Shadowcat]], [[Psylocke]], and [[Marvel Girl (Rachel Summers)|Rachel Summers]]. X-23 was approached by the [[Glossary:C#cosmic|cosmic]] Uni-Power in hopes of making specific use of her healing ability. Although she initially resisted its attempts to bond with her, and she remained reluctant even though it pleaded with her, she ultimately agreed to aid it and became Captain Universe for a brief time.\n\n[[Image:x23target.jpg|right|250px|thumb]]After the effects of [[House of M|\"M-Day\"]], X-23 was one of the few students who didn't lose their powers. The depowered students and staff were sent home; however their bus was bombed by anti-mutant religious zealot [[Stryker, William|Reverend William Stryker]]. Subsequently, [[Frost, Emma|Emma Frost]] had the surviving students engage in an all-in brawl, with those deemed to be the best performers assigned to a new team of trainee X-Men. Despite Frost's attempts to omit her, X-23 was among those students who made the grade.\n\n\nShortly afterwards, following Stryker's attack on the ex-mutant students, X-23 heard [[Dust]] talking to [[Icarus (Jay Guthrie)|Icarus]], who had fled the Mansion. Dust intended to meet Jay, but Laura told her it was a trap, and had to knock out her roommate to keep her safe. Donning Dust's burkha X-23 came to Stryker's compound and was shot. After a few minutes spent healing and playing possum, Laura returned to the Mansion to help fend off Stryker and his goons.\n\nThe team gave more respect to Laura following her part in stopping Stryker's attack, in which she single-handedly killed three Purifiers. Following that she started to bond with her friends, using her enhanced hearing to find out what happened to Icarus for them, learning that Stryker killed him.\n\nAfter Surge received a distress call from [[Forge]], X-23 followed the team along to Dallas to rescue him from the [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] [[Nimrod (Sentinel)|Nimrod]]. At the height of the desperate battle she managed to cut through to the interior of the machine with her claws, allowing the Sentinel to be defeated. She was wounded during the battle and was unable to heal herself. In order to save X-23, [[Hellion|Julian]] supercharged his [[Glossary:T#telekinetic|telekinetic]] powers with the help of Emma Frost in order to rush her back to the mansion where she was healed by [[Elixir]]. As Hellion recovered his strength, and found that his power levels were enhanced, Laura kept watch over him. Emma Frost confronted Laura, asking her to leave the school because of the trigger scent saying that she was a danger to everyone at the institute even Julian. Their conversation is cut short by Cessily ([[Mercury]]) coming to Laura's defense. Mercury persuades Laura to go for coffee and discuss Laura's crush on Julian. However, the cafe is attacked by [[Kimura]] and her minions. though Laura thought that Kimura was after her, she was really after Cessily.\n\nLaura goes back to the Xavier Institute when Hellion interrupts her as she is gearing up to attack against the facility. He informs her that he is coming with her. The two find a hide out where Laura interrogates a man at gun point. Upon securing the information she needs, X-23 shoots him in the head. Julian is shocked and tells her that killing will no longer be a part of their interrogation technique, X-23 remains silent and the two continue their search for the facility.",
