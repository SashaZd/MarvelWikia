Cloud 9 froze in shock and MVP died saving her from Armory's misfire. Camp officials covered up the incident. Later, Cloud 9's anxiety over this horrific accident triggered Trauma's fear-mirroring power and he briefly transformed her into her greatest fear, a vengeful MVP. Despite her insecurities, Cloud 9 earned the camp's highest firearms score, so War Machine issued her a pulse rifle during an Initiative fight with terrorist group [[Hydra]]; Cloud 9 downed a Hydra jet, killing the pilot. Shaken by this fatality, she struggled during subsequent training with [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)]]. The cadets later clashed with [[Zodiac]] terrorist, but were defeated. However, [[Night Thrasher (Donyell Taylor)]]'s [[New Warriors]] chased the Zodiac away at the cost of a teammate's life.",
