[[Image:Vulcan inline.jpg|left|thumb]]Meanwhile, [[Banshee]] uncovered the location of a secret tape with information about the new mutant but was killed by the [[Glossary:B#Blackbird|Blackbird]] while delivering the tape to the X-Men. The [[Beast (Henry McCoy)|Beast]] was, however, able to retrieve the tape, and the X-Men which contained revelations that the mutant, under the codename \"Kid Vulcan\" was part of a forgotten team of MacTaggert's students conscripted to help rescue a group of X-Men trapped by the [[Glossary:S#sentient|sentient]] island [[Krakoa]], some years ago. The mutant, now using the code name \"Vulcan,\" also revealed to Cyclops that he is his youngest brother. After releasing the second presence within him with the help of Marvel Girl a mutant named Darwin manifested who was apparently comatose. While fighting former heroes the X-men Vulcan left Earth denouncing Cyclops as his brother with his mind intent on destroy Emperor [[Neramani, D'Ken|D'ken]] and the Shi'ar Empire.\n\nAfter confronting and destroying Shi'ar ships near Earth, Vulcan began using stargates to lead him to Shi'ar space, he also used his powers to produce an electronic voice for himself so that he could communicate with the ships in the vacuum of space. Once he realized how far he was, he took control a starship and forced its captain to teach him about the Shi'ar Empire. The captain eventually led Vulcan to a planet where he was ambushed by the [[Imperial Guard]]. Though he was much more powerful than them Vulcan was eventually defeated, and he lost his left eye in the process. In jail, his captors gave him a [[Glossary:B#bionic|bionic]] eye, but left him alone for the most part. Vulcan began to hallucinate, seeing himself at his true calendar age of 15. Soon, however, he was released from his cell and directed to another inmate, whom he freed, finding it to be none other than [[Deathbird]], who managed to set aside Vulcans personal vandetta and started a relationship with him. Deathbird took Vulcan to the planet on which her comatose brother D'ken was residing, and for her love, Vulcan healed D'ken's broken mind. Vulcan then assisted the revived D'ken in a coup against [[Neramani, Lilandra|Lilandra]], though the Majestrix escaped with the X-Men and [[Starjammers]]. Recognizing both Vulcan's danger and his sister's love for the [[Humans|human]], D'ken next made the shocking suggestion that Vulcan marry Deathbird and join the Royal Family.",
