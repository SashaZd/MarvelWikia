During the clash, Starbolt became enraged when he saw the feral X-Man [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]] attacking his teammate and then-lover [[Oracle]]. After Starbolt flash-fried him, Wolverine quickly took the two lovers out of the fight by slamming them into each other.\n\n\nStarbolt was also one of eight Imperial Guardsmen chosen to battle the X-Men over the fate of [[Phoenix Force|Phoenix]], a primal force of the cosmos that had assumed the form of the X-Man [[Phoenix (Jean Grey)|Jean Grey]].\n\nSoon after, Starbolt was amongst those few Imperial Guard members who opposed the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord [[Samédàr]] who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by [[Deathbird]]. Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Samédàr, Starbolt remained steadfast in his loyalty to then-Empress Lilandra.\n\nLater, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne, Starbolt was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as [[Excalibur]] and the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of Jean Grey named [[Marvel Girl (Rachel Summers)|Rachel Summers]].\n\nMuch later, the intergalactic teleporter [[Cheney, Lila|Lila Cheney]] transported the X-Men to the Shi'ar Empire at the behest of then-Empress Deathbird in time to see Lilandra regain her throne.  Not all was as it seemed, however, as in reality a group of [[Warskrulls]], using technology to allow them to duplicate superpowers, had captured and impersonated the X-Men's founder, the telepathic [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], using his telepathy to control Lilandra and the Imperial Guard, including Starbolt. After the ruse was discovered by the X-Men and all the Warskrull impostors were exposed, Lilandra settled matters with Deathbird, discovering her sister did not want the throne anymore.\n\nDuring the war between the Shi'ar and [[Kree]] Empires, Starbolt was part of a small team of Guardsmen who were charged with preventing the member of the [[Earth]] team of super-powered beings known as the [[Avengers]] named [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] from retrieving the legendary Nega-Bands of the Kree warrior [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Mar-vell]], which had been stolen.\n\nSubsequently, Starbolt was amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree [[Ronan]] the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the [[Inhumans]].",
