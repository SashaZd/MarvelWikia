        "bio": "Kyle Gibney was one of the original volunteers for [[Beta Flight (Age of Apocalypse)|Beta Flight]], Canada's attempt at building a super soldier program to secure their borders against the onslaught of [[Apocalypse (Age of Apocalypse)|Apocalypse]] and his Infinite soldiers. This program did little to enhance Wild Child's mutant powers, but they appear to have taken away much of Gibney's capacity for human interaction and speech. \n\n\nDuring Canada's final days, Beta Flight was released in an attempt to slow the charge of Apocalypse's [[Infinites (Age of Apocalypse)|Infinites]]. While the Canadian evacuation planes for Iceland were being loaded, [[Holocaust (Age of Apocalypse)|Holocaust]], along with a platoon of Infinite soldiers, attempted to massacre the escaping Canadians. Wild Child fought valiantly alongside his Beta Flight team allowing hundreds to escape Nova Scotia. Holocaust killed most of Beta Flight but allowed Gibney to live. Believing Wild Child's ferocity would be an amazing asset for Apocalypse, Holocaust captured him.\n\nHolocaust would use Wild Child as his first strike against an enemy - dropped onto a battlefield, Wild Child tore apart anything in his path. But the boy could not distinguish between ally and foe. After attacking Holocaust himself during the battle of Mexico City, Wild Child was placed in the soldier rehabilitation center located on Alcatraz Island. Holocaust would later send a near-death [[Sabretooth (Age of Apocalypse)|Sabretooth]] to Alcatraz as well. He placed him in the cell with Wild Child, hoping the ferocious boy would tear Sabretooth apart. Instead, after days of fighting each other, Wild Child became subservient to Sabretooth. The two escaped Alcatraz and Sabretooth brought Wild Child with him to the [[X-Men (Age of Apocalypse)|X-Men]]. They were accepted as part of [[Magneto (Age of Apocalypse)|Magneto]]'s team despite their shady pasts.\n\nDuring the final days of Apocalypse's rule, Wild Child was a major player when Sabretooth and Holocaust fought a brutal battle. During the fight, Sabretooth was able to pry the location of the Infinite production plant in Indianapolis from Holocaust. The Horseman, believing he had already beaten Sabretooth, was surprised when Sabretooth sent Wild Child to inform the rest of the X-Men of his plans. Wild Child delivered this key information to [[Rogue (Age of Apocalypse)|Rogue]] by touching her skin and allowing her to absorb his memories.\n\nAfter Sabretooth disappeared during the final battle with Apocalypse, Wild Child became fiercely loyal to [[Morph (Age of Apocalypse)|Morph]], who would sometimes take on Sabretooth's appearance to calm Wild Child. The two of them were sent on a secret mission alongside [[Exodus (Age of Apocalypse)|Exodus]] and [[Iceman (Age of Apocalypse)|Iceman]] and the entire group disappeared. The whereabouts of this small team, and whether Wild Child is alive or dead, is unknown.",
