Even after the ploy was discovered, Hussar, like most of the other Guard members present, still chose to side with Samédàr against the X-Men who were defending then-Empress [[Neramani, Lilandra|Lilandra]].\n\nLater, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne, Hussar was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as [[Excalibur]] and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the [[Starjammers]] over the fate of the then-bearer of the [[Glossary:C#cosmic|cosmic]] Phoenix Force, the [[Glossary:A#alternate future|alternate future]] daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named [[Marvel Girl (Rachel Summers)|Rachel Summers]].\n\nMuch later, during the war between the Shi'ar and [[Kree]] Empires, Hussar was amongst a small contingent of the Imperial Guard that defended Lilandra, who had since regained the throne, against the Kree super-team known as [[Starforce]]. Hussar was also amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree [[Ronan]] the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the [[Inhumans]].\n\nFollowing a meeting of the intergalactic council, Earth was declared a threat to the entire cosmos and consequently it was deemed to turn the planet into an intergalactic prison. Criminals from numerous alien races were [[Glossary:T#teleportation|teleported]] to Earth, among them the former Imperial Guard members who had allied themselves with Deathbird and Lord Samédàr all those years ago. These former Guardsmen had allied themselves with a lone member of the alien D'bari, calling himself Starhammer, who sought revenge on Jean Grey for the crimes of Dark Phoenix.",
