Joey' stamina and agility were increased as well as his speed, which now allows him to run at 50 mph for short periods. Initially Joey needed his belt for these enhancements, but after years of exposure to its energies, they have become innate.",
        "abilities": "He produces an oscillating bio-energy frequency  that interact with nearby atomic particles to generate a self supporting force field, usually one inch away from his body, although with concentration he can extend it to encompass others within a few feet of him. This field can absorb up to 1000 psi without the Blue Shield being buffeted by the impact, easily blocking knives, bullets and fist, and some electromagnetic phenomena, such as thermal radiation, but it does not stop sound or light.The field glows blue harmless Cherenkov radiation and is imperceptible to touch from within, but feels warm and spongy from the outside. Joey is a proficient fighter who has also studied boxing, judo, and gymnastics",
