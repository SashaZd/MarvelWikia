        "bio_text": "Longshot was a genetically engineered life-form from another dimension referred to as the Wildways, \"Mojoverse\" or \"Mojoworld\" ruled by beings known as the Spineless Ones. The scientist [[Arize (Mojoverse)|Arize]] created a race of vertebrate slaves through genetic engineering. Arize secretly designed their genetic codes so that his intelligent humanoids would have a strong sense of self. For some of his creations he added superhuman abilities; Longshot was one of these creations. Grown in machines to become a warrior slave for the Spineless One named [[Mojo]], Longshot became conscious as an adult and immediately asserted his independence. Mojo forced Longshot to serve as a stuntman in his dangerous movies. Locating Arize, Longshot discovered his own origin and was encouraged to lead a slave rebellion. He became a legendary rebel leader on his world, heroically leading many of his fellow slaves against the Spineless Ones, but ultimately failed. Longshot was mind-wiped by the Spineless Ones in hopes that he would once again become a slave. With no memory of his name or his past, he escaped to Earth via an inter-dimensional portal. Mojo sent [[Spiral (Rita Wayword)|Spiral]], [[Gog (Mojoverse)|Gog]] and [[Magog (Mojoverse)|Magog]] after Longshot but they did not succeed in bringing him back to Mojoworld.",

Mojo sent [[Spiral (Rita Wayword)|Spiral]], [[Gog (Mojoverse)|Gog]] and [[Magog (Mojoverse)|Magog]] after Longshot but they did not succeed in bringing him back to Mojoworld.\n\nOn Earth, he found work as a stunt-man. There, Longshot befriended a stuntwoman co-worker named Ricochet Rita. After Spiral, Gog and Magog failed in capturing Longshot, Mojo had finally decided to find Longshot himself, along with Spiral. Mojo failed in his attempt and was sent back to the [[Mojoverse]] by Longshot, with help from Ricochet Rita, [[Quark (Mojoverse)|Quark]], and [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Doctor Strange]]. Longshot decided it was time to return to his home planet and free the slaves. This time Ricochet Rita and Quark came along with him. But Longshot's rebelion failed to overthrow the Spinless Ones.\n\nLongshot returned to Earth and joined the [[X-Men]]. A relationship between fellow X-Man, [[Dazzler (Alison Blaire)|Dazzler]], soon surfaced and the two were later married. The couple returned to Mojoworld to lead another rebellion. This time it seemed they had succeeded in freeing the slaves. The planet was once again at peace, and the couple decided to make the planet their permanent home. While in Mojoworld, Longshot and Dazzler looked after a group of Mojo-manufactured child clones of the X-Men named the [[X-Babies]]. Mojo returned to the Mojoverse and reclaimed himeslf as the ruler of the planet. Longshot once again became a rebel leader against the slavemasters. [[Phoenix (Jean Grey)|Phoenix]]  discovered that Dazzler had become pregnant with Longshot’s baby, but the baby's fate remains unrevealed. \n\nDazzler returned from the Mojoverse without Longshot by her side. She claimed Mojoworld was completely destroyed as a result of \"X-Baby\" versions of villains that were spawned from the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. The baby versions of [[Apocalypse (Age of Apocalypse)|Apocalypse]], [[Holocaust (Age of Apocalypse)|Holocaust]], [[Dark Beast]], and the [[Sugar Man (Age of Apocalypse)|Sugar Man]] had completely destroyed the entire Mojoverse, including, she claimed, her husband Longshot.\n\nHowever, Longshot was recruited by [[Sasquatch (Exiles)|Heather Hudson]] into the [[Exiles]]' ranks to aid against the threat of [[Proteus (House of M)|Proteus]]. Recently, Longshot left the Exiles to be with Dazzler.",
