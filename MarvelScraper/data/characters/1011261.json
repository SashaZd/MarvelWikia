Vin's career as an officer of the law had just begun when the long absent [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)]] returned to New York's streets. Although O'Neil and other officers were in favor of Spider-Man's continue aid in policing the city, Vin resented the wall crawler for taking matters into his own hands. Vin first encountered Spider-Man during an altercation with the villainous [[Overdrive]] and grudgingly aided him in stopping the criminal. Vin became involved in his units spider-tracer conspiracy as Palone had Vin, O'Neil and other officers plant spider-tracers on bodies to lower the unresolved crime rate.

Seeking a roommate, Vin wounded up taking in Peter, partially to appease Carlie. Little did Vin suspect, but Peter was actually Spider-Man; this led Vin into danger when Spider-Man's foe [[Kraven (Ana Kravinoff)|Ana Kravinoff]] mistook Vin for Spider-Man. Believing that she had the upper hand on her prey, Ana grabbed Vin while he was dressed in Peter's Spider-Man costume. However Vin managed to escape and Ana attempted to hunt him to his death. Peter came to Vin's rescue, dressed as [[Daredevil]], and both men survived the ordeal. Afterward, Spider-Man paid Vin a visit and claimed that he had distributed false information identifying him as Spider-Man in order to protect his true identity; this enraged Vin against Spider-Man even more. After, Palone murdered the [[Bookie]], Vin came forward about the spider-tracer deaths and testified to his role in the conspiracy. Vin went to prison and his sister Michele took over his part of the apartment, while using her skills as a lawyer to facilitate his parole.",
