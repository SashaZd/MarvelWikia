Cable was forced to shoot his son in order to save Dawnsilk, further damaging Tyler’s mind. Although the damage was eventually repaired, Tyler never forgave his father.\n\nUtilizing a time nexus within Niagara Falls, Tyler traveled back to the present to ensure Apocalypse’s rise and exact revenge on Cable. Using technology from his era, he created the identity of arms dealer Tolliver and abducted Cable’s mercenary ally Domino, replacing her with the shape-shifting mutant [[Copycat|Copycat]] so as to spy on Cable’s activities. After Cable rescued [[Domino]], Tyler faked Tolliver’s death, setting into motion a clash between various mercenaries who sought to obtain Tolliver’s advanced technology.\n\nLearning of Apocalypse’s apparent death, Tyler set out to obtain his future leader’s power for himself. Renaming himself Genesis, he persuaded Apocalypse’s former servants, the [[Dark Riders]], to capture the mutant adventurer [[Wolverine]]. Genesis sought to brainwash Wolverine into his service as his so-called Horseman Death. To this end, Genesis had the Dark Riders liberate Wolverine’s imprisoned nemesis Cyber who had Adamantium-laced skin. Genesis unleashed mutant death watch beetles on [[Cyber]] that consumed the villain’s soft tissue, leaving the inedible Adamantium behind. Genesis then attempted to bond the metal to Wolverine’s skeleton, but Wolverine broke free and went berserk, killing the Dark Riders and Genesis.",
