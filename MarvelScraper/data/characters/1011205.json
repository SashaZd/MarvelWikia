        "place_text": "Madripoor is a small island nation south of Singapore in the Indonesian archipelago. Conquered by freebooters centuries ago, its heritage of piracy evolved into the present laissez-faire government, permitting virtually any business transaction provided that the status quo is not threatened.  Madripoor does not allow criminal extradition from within its borders, making it an exotic diplomatic haven for many international criminals, who help maintain the island's stability through a sophisticated system of corruption.  Located near a major trade route, Madripoor's harbor and dock facilities are among the most extensive in the world; dependent upon imports for virtually everything, Madripoor is renowned for both its high-tech luxurious Hightown and its poverty-stricken Lowtown.",
