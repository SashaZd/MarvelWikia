When Hawkeye was appointed head of the [[West Coast Avengers|West Coast]] branch of the [[Avengers]], Mockingbird became the team's first new recruit and was instrumental in helping Hawkeye form the new team.\n\nMonths later, during a time traveling adventure in 1876, Mockingbird was abducted, drugged and abused by the crazed vigilante called the [[Phantom Rider (Lincoln Slade)|Phantom Rider]] (Lincoln Slade), who attempted to force her to become his bride. Regaining her senses, Mockingbird fought the Rider to a cliff’s edge and allowed him to fall to his death. After the West Coast Avengers returned to their home era, Mockingbird kept the nature of the Phantom Rider’s death a secret. However, the Rider’s ghost soon appeared and told the Avengers that she had been instrumental in his death, and had essentially murdered him. Distraught that an Avenger (especially his wife) had allowed a man to die, Hawkeye became estranged from his wife, and Mockingbird re-entered into government service. She participated in Operation: Vigilance, a program to provide protection from any potential threat from the [[Vision]], only to rebel once she discovered the program's full agenda. Helping the Avengers to rescue the Vision, she was gradually reconciled with Hawkeye, though their relationship never fully recovered. Together they helped train the [[Great Lakes Avengers]] and Mockingbird became good friends with [[Big Bertha|Ashley Crawford]]. \n\nMockingbird was abducted by the Skrull shortly after returning to the West Coast Avengers, as she was attempting to discuss divorce with Hawkeye. Replaced by a Skrull duplicate, her absence was not discovered before the doppleganger’s death at the hands of the demonic [[Mephisto]]. On the Skrull homeworld, Mockingbird was confronted by a duplicate [[Hawkeye]] who became obsessed with her and stalked her as she gathered information on the Skrull’s secret invasion plan. After three years at the hands of the Skrulls, she was reunited with Clint Barton (then in the guise of [[Ronin]]), founded the World Counter-terrorism Agency with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that defected at the start of Norman Osborn’s Dark Reign, and joined the Avengers alongside her ex-husband.",
