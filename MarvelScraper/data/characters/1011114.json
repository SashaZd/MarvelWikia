The hunger had made the unknown super hero so determined to satisfy his hunger that he ripped a hole in the very fabric of reality.\n\nA hunger so insatiable, it caused Spider-Man to eat his own wife and aunt, the only two people left in the world who truly loved him.\n\nWhen Mister Fantastic's plan to lure his other dimensional counterpart to their world failed, and Magneto destroyed the machine that could take them to the other dimension, they needed food. When the Silver Surfer arrived to inform the zombies that Galactus would shortly be arriving to consume their world, they ate the Surfer, each gaining some of his cosmic powers.\n\nThe zombies then devised a way to attack Galactus using a machine that would combine their cosmic blasts. It seriously hurt Galactus, and they then had a skirmish with the villains in which they apparently stopped them.\n\nThey each ate a portion of Galactus, in turn becoming like him.Also, they had the ability destroy planets and live in the vaccum of space.\n\nWhen the survivors had returned from the ultimate dimension, they noticed that the zombies disappeared.But, they returned and spiderman was killed by Forge and the Black Panther.",
