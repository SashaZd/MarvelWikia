Quitting the Ultimates in protest after they began operating uninvited in foreign countries, Thor was publicly accused by [[Captain America (Ultimate)|Captain America]] of leaking team secrets. Thor later intervened to protect protestors from police at an Italian demonstration against the European Defence Initiative's super-soldier program. Persuaded by Gunnar Golmen that Thor was simply a madman using stolen technology, the Ultimates and the E.D.I. hunted down Thor in Norway, attacking him despite his claims that Gunnar was actually Loki in disguise. Thor held his own until [[Quicksilver (Ultimate)|Quicksilver]] removed his belt, depriving him of his powers. \n\n[[image:ThorUlt01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Thor fighting Loki]]\nHe was then moved to the same holding cell that Bruce Banner had previously occupied.  When Loki and the Liberator's attacked, the Ultimates realized that Loki had been deceiving them.  The [[Scarlet Witch (Ultimate)|Scarlet Witch]] then summoned Thor from his cell to finish off Loki.  Loki tried again to warp reality to make Thor appear insane, but because the Ultimates' faith in Thor had been restored, his powers didn't work.  As a last-ditch effort, Loki summoned the beasts of Asgard to attack the Ultimates.  Thor then called on his father, Odin, who sent reinforcements in the form of the Knights of Asgard, to aid the Ultimates in their fight.  While the Ultimates fought the monsters, Thor battled Loki, and eventually banished him back to Asgard.\n\nWith the battle over, Thor tells the Ultimates that the planet is now under his protection.  With the team now knowing that he is truly a God, Thor rejoins the now government-independent team once more.",
