While escaping with the money, Screwball was perused by the web-slinging [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker), who foiled her escape by planting a Spider-Tracer upon her clothing. Screwball was aware of the string of \"Spider-Tracer killings\" within the city, and she became scared after discovering the tracer. She frantically dislodged the tracer from her clothing and turned herself into the police. However, she was quickly bailed out by the opportunistic [[Bookie]], who in exchange for his help convinced Screwball to impersonate Spider-Man and fight an obscure villain known as [[Basher]]. However, the plan fell apart when the real Spider-Man arrived on the scene and captured and unmasked the unseasoned Screwball. Cornered, she confessed the details of the swindle, and gave Spider-Man directions to the [[\"Bar With No Name\"]], where she was to meet the Bookie and collect her payment.",
