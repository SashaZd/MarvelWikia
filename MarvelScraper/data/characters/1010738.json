Their activities included fighting [[Mister Sinister|Mr. Sinister]] and a rogue Madrox duplicate; teaming with the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]] and the [[Pantheon]] in the war-torn nation of Trans-Sabal; failing to stop the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] from killing a doctor who had developed a way to test unborn children for the mutant gene; protecting State's witness [[Shrew (Marilyn Maycroft)|Shrew]] from [[Cyber]] and her former team, [[Hell's Belles]]; preventing a revamped [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] from recruiting the Genoshan refugee [[X-Patriots]]; joining the hunt for [[Cable]] after he seemingly shot [[Professor X|Professor Xavier]]; and struggles with mercenary mutant [[Random]], who would be both an enemy and ally. During a trip to Genosha, Madrox (actually a duplicate) contracted the [[Legacy Virus]]. Shortly thereafter, Val lost the team's trust due to her involvement with a Sentinel program and was replaced as liaison by the mutant technosmith [[Forge]].\n\nThe mutant prophetess [[Haven (Radha Dastoor)|Haven]] cured Wolfsbane of her mutate conditioning but the team suffered their first tragedy with the apparent death of Madrox from the Legacy Virus. As a result, Havok briefly quit the team, and Forge took over as leader. Mutant terrorist Mystique was added to the team by the government, and Strong Guy suffered a heart attack from a power overload, sending him into a deep coma. Wolfsbane quit the team, traveling to Muir Island where she joined [[Excalibur]] and was replaced by [[Wild Child]]. Next the hologramatic mutant [[Shard]], sister of [[Bishop (Lucas Bishop)|Bishop]], was recruited and the team battled the trickster-god the [[Adversary]] alongside [[Roma]]. After the government forced sociopath [[Sabretooth]] onto the team, Havok seemingly went rogue and formed the Brotherhood. Soon after, both Madrox and Strong Guy were found to be alive, and unwilling members Mystique and Sabretooth rebelled. Forge quit shortly before Havok returned, and X-Factor joined with the time-traveling [[Xavier Underground Enforcers]] in a mission to save the future. The X.U.E. members then joined a reorganized X-Factor, including Polaris and Madrox, but the new team was shortlived after Havok was seemingly killed in an explosion, though he was actually shunted to an alternate reality ([[Earth-1298]]).\n\n== Private Investigations ==\n\nMadrox formed a new X-Factor team, the [[X-Factor Investigations]], a private investigation firm that has no relation with the government, as the previous incarnations of X-Factor. However, Val Cooper is trying to recruit the current X-Factor team, but the team does not agree. Currently, the team is also called simply \"X-Factor.\"",
