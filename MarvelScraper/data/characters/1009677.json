Believing Kwannon’s consciousness lost, Tsurayaba attempted to remake Psylocke as an assassin in the service of the would-be conqueror the Mandarin, but Psylocke broke free of her conditioning, and together with the feral mutant [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]] and the young mutant [[Jubilee]], they defeated the Hand and the Mandarin.",

Tsurayaba hoped to use Wolverine’s memories and healing factor to stabilize the dangerous mutant, but the X-Men foiled his plans. He escaped and, cybernetically augmenting members of the Hand as the Death Touch Cult, attempted a takeover of Clan Yashida, led by Wolverine’s lover [[Yashida, Mariko|Mariko Yashida]]. Wolverine and his allies intervened, but not before Tsurayaba had Yashida fatally poisoned. Wolverine swore a prolonged vengeance, gouging out Tsurayaba’s right eye and promising to gradually disfigure him in future.\n\nTsurayaba next surfaced at a criminal summit to divide the territories of the [[Kingpin]] of crime, but the bargaining was interrupted by costumed crimefighters [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]], [[Nomad (Jack Monroe)|Nomad]], and the [[Punisher (Frank Castle)|Punisher]]. Returning to Japan, Tsurayaba was confronted by Kwannon, whose consciousness inhabited Psylocke’s original body. Now calling herself Revanche, she was dying of the mutant-killing Legacy Virus and had come seeking a swift death. The grieving Tsurayaba obliged her, and then threw himself back into his work. He led an alliance between the Hand and the terrorist organization [[Hydra]] in an attempted takeover of the island nation of [[Madripoor]], but his plan was foiled once again by Wolverine and his allies.\n\nTsurayaba has been periodically disfigured by Wolverine in keeping with the X-Man’s vow. Tsurayaba was last seen preparing to commit suicide upon Wolverine’s next visit, which was forestalled by Wolverine’s near death at the hands of his arch-nemesis [[Sabretooth]].",
