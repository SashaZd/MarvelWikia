Rasputin claims to be responsible for hundreds of deaths throughout various dimensions. Multiple interdimensional travels initially appeared to have eroded Rasputin's sanity, but it now seems his mind was being manipulated by a symbiotic entity, from whose influence he has since been released. When he last encountered his brother, Rasputin seemed to have regained his sanity.",
