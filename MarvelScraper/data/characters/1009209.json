During an encounter with the enigmatic [[Stranger]], Magneto and the Toad were captured and taken to the Stranger's homeworld, shortly after which Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch joined a revamped version of the [[Avengers]] led by [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]].\n\nAfter a tenure with the subversive organization [[Factor Three]] (intended to become a third major world power), Blob, Mastermind, and Unus banded together as a new Brotherhood. Following a failed attempt to settle the score with the X-Men, the trio were able to make the [[Beast]] believe he had killed the Avenger [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]] and manipulated him into joining until he realized the truth and single-handedly defeated them. Eventually returning to Earth, Magneto re-formed the Brotherhood with Blob, Mastermind, Unus, and the [[Savage Land Mutates|Savage Land Mutate]] [[Lorelei (Savage Land)|Lorelei]] to assist him in the creation of a being with unlimited power that he dubbed [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant|Alpha]], the Ultimate Mutant. In an encounter with the [[Defenders]], the rapidly evolving Alpha unleashed his powers, reducing the Brotherhood to a state of infancy. Subsequently restored to adulthood by [[Eric the Red]] of the alien [[Shi'ar]] race, Magneto formed a new Brotherhood comprising [[Lifter]], [[Burner]], [[Shocker (Randall Darby)|Shocker]], [[Slither]], and [[Peepers|Peeper]]. When they failed to capture the mutant with two bodies known as [[Mister One and Mister Two]], Magneto abandoned this team, though they remained together as the Mutant Force and later temporarily became the Resistants.\n\nThe mutant shapeshifter [[Mystique]] formed her own Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, recruiting Blob, [[Pyro]], [[Avalanche]], [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]], and her own foster daughter, [[Rogue]]. Mystique sent the Brotherhood against Carol Danvers, then known as [[Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers)|Ms. Marvel]] (later Binary and Warbird), which ultimately led to Rogue absorbing and retaining Danvers' powers and memories. Mystique intended for the Brotherhood to assassinate then-anti-mutant [[Kelly, Robert|Senator Kelly]], but they met defeat after the X-Men intervened and were incarcerated. Rogue freed the imprisoned members from captivity, but the male members were quickly recaptured after a struggle with the Galadorian [[Spaceknights|Spaceknight]] named [[Rom]]. Mystique then sought to recruit the [[Dire Wraiths|Dire Wraith]]/human half-breed [[Hybrid (James Marks)|Hybrid]] as a member; however, he proved too powerful for her to control, and the \"Sisterhood\" eventually aided Rom in temporarily destroying Hybrid. Subsequent efforts to target the X-Man [[Archangel|Angel]] led to an encounter with Alison Blaire, the [[Dazzler (Alison Blaire)|Dazzler]], with whom Rogue quickly developed a fierce rivalry until Dazzler definitively defeated her.\n\nRogue eventually left the Brotherhood to seek help with controlling her powers and joined the X-Men. Soon after, Mystique's Brotherhood gained the support of the United States government by apprehending Magneto and became the first government-sponsored mutant team, [[Freedom Force]]. The team's ranks swelled with the addition of vigilantes [[Commando (Frank Bohannan)|Crimson Commando]], [[Super Sabre]], and [[Stonewall]], as well as the interdimensional [[Spiral (Rita Wayword)|Spiral]] and Julia Carpenter, the new [[Arachne (Julia Carpenter)|Spider-Woman]]. Freedom Force conducted various missions for the government, ultimately losing both Destiny and Stonewall in battle against the cyborg [[Reavers]] on [[Muir Island]]. After Mystique, Spiral, and Spider-Woman left the team, the remaining members were sent on a mission to rescue nuclear physicist [[Kurtzmann, Reinhold|Reinhold Kurtzmann]] from captivity in Kuwait. The operation went awry after they encountered the Arab super team [[Desert Sword]]. During the battle, Pyro killed both Kurtzman and Desert Sword operative [[Veil]], Super Sabre was beheaded by Aminedi, and Crimson Commando was critically injured. Avalanche and Commando managed to escape alongside a squad of American soldiers, leaving Blob and Pyro to be captured.\n\nEventually the Toad sought to form a new Brotherhood, recruiting Blob, Pyro, [[Sauron]], and [[Phantazia]], and allied with the [[Morlocks]] to take down the mutant strike team [[X-Force]]. During the battle, both Sauron and the Morlocks' leader [[Masque (Morlock)|Masque]] were seemingly killed; however both later resurfaced, with Sauron rejoining the Brotherhood prior to a failed attack on [[X-Factor]]. Following a clash with the crime-fighting [[Darkhawk]] and the enigmatic [[Sleepwalker]] over the interdimensional mutant [[Portal]], Toad's Brotherhood disbanded.\n\nSoon after, X-Factor's then-leader [[Havok]] sought to expose the [[Clan Destine]] genetic experiments of the alternate reality [[Dark Beast]]. He created the impression that he had decided [[Professor X|Xavier]]'s dream was futile and re-formed the Brotherhood as a proactive mutant team against humanity, abandoning the \"evil mutants\" tag. With the telepathic [[Ever]], Havok faked an assassination attempt on [[Daily Bugle (Building)|Daily Bugle]] publisher [[Jameson, J. Jonah|J. Jonah Jameson]] which was stopped by the X-Men. Havok then recruited the Dark Beast and his assassin [[Fatale]] into the Brotherhood in order to keep closer watch on the Dark Beast's activities, as well as [[X-Man|Nate Grey]]. After Havok's true motives were revealed and the Dark Beast was defeated, Havok disbanded the Brotherhood and returned to X-Factor.\n\nThe next incarnation of the team came when Professor Xavier was imprisoned by the government-sanctioned [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]. Freed by a new Brotherhood of Mutants led by the Blob and consisting of Toad, [[Post]] and [[Mimic (Calvin Rankin)|Mimic]], Xavier agreed to train them to better their chances of survival against the then-sentient computer [[Cerebro]]. After Cerebro was defeated by Xavier, the Brotherhood was employed by Mystique to recover the remains of X-51, the [[Machine Man]], after which she reorganized the team. Mystique recruited some of her old teammates along with [[Sabretooth]], Toad, Post, and [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Mastermind]] (Martinique Jason) with a view to launching another assassination attempt on then-presidential candidate Senator Kelly. As Mystique, Sabretooth and Toad created a diversion by attacking the Muir Island Research Facility, Post, Blob, Avalanche, and Mastermind targeted Kelly. In response, the X-Men split into two groups to stop the Brotherhood but were unable to prevent the destruction of Muir. They would have been too late to save Kelly if not for the timely arrival of former Brotherhood member Pyro, who was in the final stages of the deadly mutant-killing Legacy Virus and sought to redeem himself before he died. Pyro sacrificed his life to incinerate Post, thus preventing Kelly's death. Despite this selfless act, Kelly was ultimately killed by an anti-mutant protester who believed him to be a race traitor.\n\nFollowing Mystique's imprisonment, many of the Brotherhood members were recruited by former X-Man [[Banshee]] into the paramilitary [[X-Corps]] group, leaving the way clear for a terrorist coalition to claim the name of The Brotherhood. Formed by mutant activists [[Hoffman]] and [[Marshal]], this militant group engaged in worldwide terrorist activities before Marshal ultimately quit over Hoffman's growing hunger for power. Marshal became a government agent intent on taking Hoffman down and managed to convince three captured Brotherhood members to sell Hoffman out in exchange for their freedom. Ultimately, this Brotherhood was dismantled after many of its members, including Hoffman, were killed during a failed assassination attempt on [[Doop]] of the celebrity mutant group X-Force.\n\nAfter infiltrating Xavier's school in the guise of the mutant healer [[Xorn]], a Magneto imposter adopted the Institute's special class of students - [[Basilisk (mutant)|Basilisk]], [[Ernst]], [[Johansson, Martha|Martha Johansson]], [[Beak]], and [[Angel (Angel Salvadore)|Angel]] - as his Brotherhood. Joined by Toad and [[Stepford Cuckoos|Esme]] of the Stepford Cuckoos, the faux Magneto attempted a hostile takeover of Manhattan. However, his inability to control the resulting chaos resulted in the fracturing of the Brotherhood after he inadvertently killed Basilisk and was himself decapitated by [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]].\n\nBrotherhood was reorganized by Magneto's former [[Acolytes|Acolyte]] [[Exodus]], who recruited [[Cassidy, Black Tom|Black Tom]], Avalanche, Sabretooth, [[Mammomax]], and [[Nocturne (Talia Wagner)|Nocturne]] for an all-out attack on the X-Men. The Brotherhood planned their attack based on inside knowledge provided by an apparent turncoat X-Man, the [[Juggernaut (Cain Marko)|Juggernaut]]; however, he was revealed to be a mole planted by the X-Men. After a pitched battle, Exodus' Brotherhood was defeated when the X-Man Xorn created a black hole from the microscopic star in his brain which pulled them in and closed behind them. \n\nRecently, the Brotherhood was apparently reformed by the New Mutants: Cannonball, Magma, Moonstar and Sunspot, however, it was a ruse created by [[Donald Pierce]], disguised as [[Cyclops]].",
