Vermin attempted to run the unwanted intruder out of the sewers but failed, due to the interference of the real Spider-Man dressed in the costume of [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]]. Vermin escaped into the tunnels of the sewers. He later ran into the real Daredevil who he led to Spider-Man and Gonzales, who were now both captives of Kraven. Vermin battled the female once more, and it appeared that he would be the victor, although, he was last seen badly beaten on the floor of an unknown location, at the feet of Kraven's mother.",
