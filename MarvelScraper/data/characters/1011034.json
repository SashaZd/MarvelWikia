He can even add wings, a tail, or other parts. Though his body is constantly decaying, he is effectively immortal and can survive even in a virtually skeletal state until he can gain new parts. On contact he releases a molecular acid that swiftly targets a victim's joint and surrounding tissue, enabling him to tear a new limb from anyone in range. In addition, toxins introduced into a body part will not spread systemically unless he wishes them to; he has sometimes taken poison to prevent piranhas from devouring him.",

In the Dark Ages of [[Earth-88194]] (Shadowline), the still mostly human Shreck served as squire to the future [[Doctor Zero (Earth-88194)|Doctor Zero]]. Later, he fought as a black knight and found a woman to love him. \n\nIn the 20th century of Earth-88194 he served as enforcer for the Ravenscore crime family. He was sent to terminate the [[Knight of St. George (Earth-88194)|Knight of St. George]], Michael Devlin, but was torn between separating train cars; he joined Doctor Zero to destroy the illusion-casting terrorist [[Marid (Earth-88194)|Marid]] before Devlin finally disposed of Shreck via piranha. Rebuilding himself, Shreck somehow traveled to [[Marvel Universe|Earth-616]] (mainstream Earth) and established himself as the mercenary Terror, soon encountering the likes of [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Dr. Strange]] and [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]]. Unable to kill target [[Barbatos, Roger|Roger Barbatos]] due to an immortality pact with [[Beelzeboul]], Terror used the Hellfire Serpent to empower Mikal Drakonmegas as [[Hellfire]] and briefly trade him to Mikal's father Beelzeboul in exchange for cancelling the pact. \n\nTerror's other adventures included teaming with Wolverine against eco-terrorists [[Monkey Wrench]] and [[Ecotage]]; encountering the [[Punisher (Frank Castle)|Punisher]] while taking out [[Jones, Ray|Ray \"Piranha\" Jones]]; a conspiracy to create war in the Central American nation [[Medisuela]]; seeking the power of the Carnal Serpent and battling the god [[Priapus]] alongside [[Cage, Luke|Cage]] and [[Silver Sable]]; and joining [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] in banishing the demon [[Culex]]. Terror employs [[Primo, Alexis|Ms. Alexis Primo]], his personal assistant; [[Boneyard]], to supply desired body parts; [[Brunnhilda]], his tailor; and [[Rekrab]], his occult expert.",
