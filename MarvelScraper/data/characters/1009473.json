Humanity's chief defender against Nightmare is the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Doctor Strange]], who has fought the demon so often that Strange routinely casts a protective spell on himself before sleeping. \n\n\nNightmare has also faced many other foes such as [[Clea]], [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], the [[Micronauts]], [[Dazzler (Alison Blaire)|Dazzler]], Ghost Rider ([[Ghost Rider (John Blaze)|John Blaze]] and [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Dan Ketch]]), the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]], [[Cloak]] & [[Dagger]], [[Excalibur]], [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]], [[Straw Man]], [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]], [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]], [[Sleepwalker]], the [[Enchantress]], [[Heimdall]], [[Morbius]], [[Frost, Emma|Emma Frost]], [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]], [[Black Panther (T'Challa)|Black Panther]] and [[Moon Knight]]. Nightmare has worked to corrupt unstable super-beings such as the Hulk and Cloak, each of whom have gone on mad Nightmare-inspired rampages, but his influence usually proves temporary. For a time, Nightmare was allied with rival fear-sowing entities such as the [[Fear Lords]], but the group was thwarted by [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Dr. Strange]] and his allies. \n\nEight hundred years ago, Nightmare impregnated the demon succubus [[Zhilla Char]]; she died giving birth to their daughter, the [[Dreamqueen]], who now rules her own nightmarish pocket [[Glossary:D#dimension|dimension]]. For a time, Nightmare courted horror movie actress Roxanne in the mortal guise of Edvard Haberdash, helping her longtime director Lucre establish Club Fear where patrons paid to be terrified. \"Edvard\" eventually caused Lucre's demise, and Roxanne forced herself to keep dating the abusive, possessive, inhuman \"Edvard\" since she feared for her own safety and that of the world in the face of a wrathful Nightmare's power. During a recent terror attack, Nightmare exploited humanity's desire that it was just a dream, gaining a foothold on an earthly island where he can manipulate reality at whim. On Nightmare Island, the Hulk encountered and named Daydream, a daughter Nightmare had sired with a mortal woman in a deep sleep, who turned against her father and chose to dwell amongst humanity. Nightmare's natural enemies include the denizen [[Dusk (demon)|Dusk]] of the hostile adjacent [[Realm of Madness]], as well as the [[Gulgol]], a monster who never sleeps.",
