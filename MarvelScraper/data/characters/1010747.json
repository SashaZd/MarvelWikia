Running away from their homes, the group banded together and began a journey of discovery, both of their parents' origins and of their own inherited powers. [[Arsenic (and Old Lace)|Arsenic]] found she could control her time-traveling parents' dinosaur, which she named [[Arsenic (and Old Lace)|Old Lace]]; [[Sister Grimm]] took her mother's magical Staff of One, with which she could cast any spell, but only once; the mutant [[ Bruiser (Molly Hayes)|Bruiser]] found that with puberty came super strength; [[Lucy In The Sky|Lucy in the Sky]] learned that she was an alien with energy powers; [[Talkback]] took several of his mad scientist parents' weapons; however, [[Wilder, Alex|Alex Wilder]], possessing only his own natural genius, retained use of his real name. \n\nForced to fight their parents at various points, the group was even framed for the murder of the girl whom they had earlier witnessed their parents sacrificing. Taking an old abandoned mansion which they called the Hostel as their new home, the Runaways set about clearing their name. Breaking up a robbery, the group welcomed a new member, a teen named Topher who claimed his parents forced him to help them with their crimes. [[Topher]], in actuality a vampire born at the turn of the 20th century, set about seducing both Sister Grimm and Lucy in the Sky, but was killed when he attempted to drink Lucy's solar-irradiated alien blood. The Pride then exposed his followers to sunlight, killing them as well. \n\nUsing their more legitimate connections the Pride convinced [[Cloak]] and [[Dagger]] to come to California and collect their kids. After a misunderstanding, most of the Runaways ended up inside of Cloak's cloak dimension, leaving only Bruiser and Arsenic to rescue them. Upon explaining their situation, the Runaways convinced Cloak and Dagger of their innocence, and the duo promised to call Captain America to help them, although their memories were erased by the Pride before they could do so. The discovery of the Hostel by the police, whom the Pride had in their pocket, forced the Runaways to take the battle to their parents once more. \n[[image:runaways01.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Nico Minoru aka Sister Grimm]]\nDiscovering their parents served ancient beings known as the Gibborim who intended to re-create the Earth using the Pride as their catalysts and repopulators, the Runaways found the location where the Pride intended to sacrifice the soul of the girl they had murdered. Confronting their parents, the Runaways were shocked when Alex Wilder revealed his alliance with the Pride. Despite the defection, the Runaways were able to free the young girl's soul, causing the Gibborim to attack and apparently slay Alex and the Pride. Narrowly escaping, the group met [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]], who had them placed in foster homes and orphanages; Bruiser was enrolled at the [[Xavier Institute For Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]]. \n\nMissing each other, the group again ran away and agreed to stay together as Runaways. Rescuing Arsenic's dinosaur, Old Lace, and taking Talkback's parents' giant vehicle, the Leapfrog, the group set out, determined to make something more of their new family. \n\nWith the death of the Pride, Los Angeles' 'protected' status was ended, and super-villains began flock to the unprotected city. With no one else to do the job, the Runaways returned to L.A. to protect it. They have fought [[Swarm]], the [[Wrecking Crew]], and, perhaps in their biggest struggle to date, a new Pride formed of Alex Wilder's online friends, led by a resurrected [[Wilder, Geoffrey|Geoffrey Wilder]].",
