In the aftermath of this, and realising that using his power \"felt right\", he left the Institute.\n\nSome months later, Dani, with the help of Emma Frost set out to bring him back to the school, to fill the sixth place on the formalised New Mutants squad, mentored by Dani. While Kevin was still angry at Dani, Emma managed to persuade him to return, and he joined the New Mutants squad under the codename Wither. Clashing with [[Elixir]], the current object of Laurie's affections who he'd last seen as one of Pierce's [[Reavers]], [[Mercury (Cessily Kincaid)|Mercury]], the only person he could touch without killing, reached out to him, having developed a crush on him. Shortly after he returned to the school he was arrested by the FBI for killing his father. While the Hellions tried to \"rescue\" him (Mercury coming in through a window to let him know), the New Mutants tried to stop them - fearing the consequences of involving the Institute in a fight with the FBI - until the [[X-Men]] arrived and ended the fight, taking them all back to the Institute before they were discovered. This was the final straw, however, and he swapped squads with [[Icarus (Jay Guthrie)|Icarus]] to become a Hellion.Recently, he discovered Elixir's former relationship with [[Wolfsbane]] and released it to the school, successfully ending Josh's relationship with Laurie.\nDuring [[House of M|M-Day]], when most of the world's mutants lost their powers, Kevin mistakenly thought he had lost his powers also. He touched Laurie's hand making it withered and after feeling more guilty and depressed he ran away from the Institute. \n\nRecently, Wither joined [[Selene]]'s Inner Circle and died fighting Elixir.",
