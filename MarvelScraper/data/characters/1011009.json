Barrett was ready to send her back to Venezuela before [[Moonstar|Danielle Moonstar]] arrived to offer Sofia a place at [[Xavier Institute For Higher Learning|Xavier's]].\n\n\nAt the institute, Sofia was able to find friends and maintain her optimistic outlook on life. She befriended her roomate, Wallflower and the two friends became the core of the training squad, the New Mutants.  Given the codename Wind Dancer, Sofia stepped up to lead the New Mutants. But her headstrong ways, and her tendency to let the negative build up inside of her until she exploded, made her a less than ideal candidate. She eventually asked [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|Prodigy]], her genius teammate, to take over as leader. But Prodigy recognized that Wind Dancer was the emotional heart of the team. The two agreed to lead the squad together.\n\nThe New Mutants had an up and down year. They lost out in squad competitions to the rival [[Hellions (squad)|Hellions]] and were sunk by interpersonal problems within the squad. Sofia grew attracted to [[Hellion|Julian Keller]], leader of the Hellions. Their squads' rivalry has kept the two from becoming a couple, but Julian is certainly a key figure in Sofia's life.\n\nFollowing [[House of M|\"M-Day\"]], however, Sofia was de-powered, and while Julian wanted to keep seeing her, she was turned off by his attitude towards the other ex-[[Mutants|mutants]], and his support of [[Frost, Emma|Emma's]] decision to send them home. Sofia apparently was picked up from the school, and was not on the bus that was bombed by [[Stryker, William|Stryker]].",
