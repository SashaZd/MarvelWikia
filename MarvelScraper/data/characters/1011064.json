The [[Mysterium|Nth Man]] was threatening to destroy the [[Earth-712]] dimension, and the former Squadron members and the Redeemers banded together to combat it. They got on a shuttle and went into space to fight it. In the ensuing battle Inertia was killed when she tried to invert the expansion of the Nth Man, and her body was vaporized.",
