Thomas was codenamed Synch as a result of his mutant ability.\n\nSynch quickly became popular with his teammates, and formed particularly close bonds to[[Jubilee]] and [[Skin]], and later with [[M (Monet St. Croix)|M]]. Eager to learn more about his powers, he spent his time at the academy pushing himself as far as he could go, and often annoyed the others by using their powers better than they themselves could. Soon after, the team was attacked by the energy vampire known as [[Emplate]], who transformed Synch into a creature like him that was forced to feed on the bone marrow of mutants for survival. Emplate teleported Synch to his home in St. Louis, where he attempted to turn his family into creatures like himself and Emplate. He was freed of Emplate’s influence by a combination of his own reluctance to bring harm to people he loves, and the assistance of his teammates [[Husk]], M, and Jubilee.\n\nLater, after [[Frost, Adrienne|Adrienne Frost]], elder sister of Generation X’s former headmistress [[Frost, Emma|Emma Frost]], incited a riot at the school, Synch sacrificed his life to save the students by attempting to disarm a bomb Adrienne had planted that subsequently exploded. \n\nRecently, Synch was revived with an alien techno organic virus.",
