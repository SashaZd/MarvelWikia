Pym fled, but he was caught and beaten into traction by [[Captain America (Ultimate)|Captain America]], who soon began dating Jan. \n\n\nPym was dismissed from the field team, and his former assistant Eamonn Brankin took over their R&D operations; however, Hank remained on staff. He formed an unlikely friendship and fertile scientific collaboration with fellow outcast Bruce Banner, while trying unsuccessfully to rejoin the Ultimates field team as the self-shrinking \"Ant-Man\". When Banner was sentenced to die for the Hulk's crimes, Pym covertly sabotaged the execution, facilitating Banner's secret escape. Finally fired from the Ultimates altogether, a desperate Pym was willing to work for free, even offering them his new Ultron and Vision robot designs;he was rejected. Pym joined a new amateur super-team, the Defenders, romancing his teammate Valkyrie, but the group's ineptitude soon drove Hank away. Weary of her new boyfriend, Jan secretly struck up a platonic friendship with Hank; but by this time, the desperate Pym had secretly allied himself with a traitor within the Ultimates to plot the team's downfall.",
