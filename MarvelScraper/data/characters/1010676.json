        "bio": "Colleen Wing was born to Professor Lee Wing and a Japanese woman, whose name has not been given. Colleen's mother apparently died very early in her childhood, and then her father became busy with teaching. She was then raised in Japan by her grandfather Kanji Ozawa. Kanji taught Colleen the ways of a samurai, in which she became highly skilled.\n\n\nColleen Wing shortly dated [[Cyclops (Scott Summers)|Cyclops]], leader of the [[X-Men]], when [[Phoenix (Jean Grey)|Jean Grey]] was assumed dead. \n\nColleen went back to New York to visit her father and upon arrival she was caught in a gun battle by Manhattan police and thugs. She was then rescued by [[Knight%2C_Misty|Misty Knight]], who eventually became her best friend. Later on, Knight's right arm became severely injured and ultimately had to be amputated. Colleen encouraged Knight to overcome her depression and start living life again. Knight acknowledged Colleen's advice, and she then replaced her amputated arm with a [[Glossary:B#bionic|bionic]] arm. \n\nColleen Wing and Misty Knight created an association as private detectives and called it Knightwing Restorations, Ltd. Because of Wing and Knight's expertise in martial arts, Knightwing Restorations was renamed Daughters of the Dragon. \n\nWhen the [[Civil War|Superhuman Registration Act]] became law, Misty Knight and Colleen were contacted by [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]] to start up a new [[Heroes for Hire]] in order to capture [[Glossary:S#superhuman|superhumans]] that have not registered. They were backed by Stark and their roster included [[Black Cat]], [[Shang-Chi]], [[Orka]], [[Humbug]] and the new [[Tarantula (Maria Vasquez)|Tarantula]]. Together, the group found themselves face-to-face with those they considered allies like [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] as well as enemies such as the [[Headmen]]. Ultimately, the Heroes for Hire suffered more than they triumphed due to betrayals, death and losing themselves somewhere along the line, so the team disbanded. Misty told Colleen she didn't know what went wrong - that they were supposed to be Heroes for Hire. Colleen remarked they should have just been heroes.\n\nWhen [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]] took over Hell's Kitchen, New York, Colleen was invited to lead a group of female assassins employed by the [[Hand]] called the [[Nail]]. Her mother led the Nail at one time, and Colleen was promised more information about her mother's mysterious past if she took her rightful place with them. She agreed, and led her team on several successful missions against various criminal organizations. However, when Colleen's naive friend, Tig, was taken prisoner for being employed by a corrupt councilman, she made a stand against the Hand. This betrayal resulted in a challenge for the Nail's leadership by fellow member [[Black Lotus]]. Colleen was captured by the Nail but escaped Daredevil's fortress with the help of another Nail member, [[Cherry Blossom]]. Colleen still had to return to save her friend, but first went to reconcile with Misty. Colleen infiltrated the stronghold, saved Tig and faced Lotus again, defeating her. The Hand allowed her to leave without further incident. \n\nTwo weeks later, Colleen returned to detective work and took a job to find a missing person in Japan. She was accompanied by Cherry Blossom and Tig.",
