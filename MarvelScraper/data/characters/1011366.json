However, Galactus dispersed this power. The Sphinx does not possess this power any longer, though he apparently still retains small threads of Xandarian knowledge. He possesses the accumulated knowledge of thousands of years of experience and also possesses knowledge of alien technologies learned from the Caretakers.",

        "paraphernalia": "Sphinx possesses the Ka stone, which can alter reality within a several-mile radius, but he usually employs it in less dramatic fashion to conserve its power. He has projected blasts of force, heat and light from his eyes and hands or from the stone, created elaborate illusions, teleported over long distances, and enhanced his own strength (allowing him to lift 85 tons), endurance and lifespan. The stone allows for unprotected space flight, eliminating the need for oxygen. Mut has also used the stone to create several bases of operation, including a flying pyramid and recreations of the Temple",
