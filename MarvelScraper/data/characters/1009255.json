        "bio": "Crystal was born into the royal family of the [[Inhumans]], a hidden race preoccupied with genetics. The Inhumans developed the Terrigan Mists, a mutagenic compound routinely applied to Inhuman children, as with Crystal, who was exposed in infancy.\n\nWhen Crystal's sister [[Medusa]] disappeared, Crystal and other Inhuman royalty searched the globe for her, ultimately finding her and returning to Attilan with the aid of the [[Fantastic Four]]. Along the way, a passionate romance blossomed between Crystal and the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]]. Though they were at first kept apart by her Inhuman family, and later a Negative Zone barrier that [[Maximus]] created around [[Attilan]]. But after [[Black Bolt]] used his powerful voice to destroy the barrier, the Inhuman's Council of Elders soon made the decision to split up the royal family while the city was being rebuilt. Then Crystal and her cousins left their sanctuary, with Black Bolt's agreement. Crystal was finally free to pursue Johnny, and with Black Bolt's approval, she rejoined him. Together with the Fantastic Four, she helped fight the newly escaped [[Blastaar]], and continued to assist them, though she was usually restrained from active participation by an overly concerned Johnny Storm. Eventually, when the [[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl]] gave birth to her first child, Crystal made herself a Fantastic Four uniform and announced that she would be her replacement. Skeptical, [[Mister Fantastic]] agreed to think about it, but after stopping the newest series of attacks from the criminal, [[Wizard]], Crystal earned her place on the Marvel Universe's first family. Crystal was later captured by Maximus, using a controlled Lockjaw, after he had retaken the Inhuman throne. But Black Bolt once again used his destructive voice to free them and send Maximus scurrying to a hidden rocket. Crystal first had to leave the Fantastic Four when Black Bolt injured himself in a radiation experiment, and he needed her to use her powers to vibrate his heart until [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] could return with medicine. Crystal was finally forced to leave the team when she passed out and Reed discovered that Earth's pollutants were slowly killing her. Johnny took it badly, but Reed stopped him before he could jump into Lockjaw's teleportation field.\n\nEn route to Attilan, Crystal rescued and tended the wounded [[Quicksilver]]. A whirlwind romance ensued, and by the time Quicksilver had recovered, they were engaged. Crystal and Quicksilver were married and settled down in Attilan, the first-ever Inhuman marriage to a non-Inhuman. At first, Crystal and Pietro were very happy together, especially after Crystal gave birth to their daughter Luna; but serious tensions arose. Pietro wanted to expose Luna to the Terrigan Mists rather than have her remain an ordinary girl, but Crystal forbade it. Quicksilver immersed himself in his role as commander of the Inhuman militia, while a lonely and bored Crystal had an affair with a real estate salesman Norm Webster. When Pietro found out, he went mad and fled Attilan. Crystal rejoined the Fantastic Four, trying unsuccessfully to rekindle her old romance with Johnny.\n\nPietro eventually recovered from his breakdown, and he and Crystal have made several attempts at reconciliation, including a period during which they served together as [[Avengers]]. Crystal joined their ranks as her way of atoning for her various personal failures. However, Crystal's romantic link to the team's [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] helped sour the marriage yet again, and the couple have been separated as of late.",
