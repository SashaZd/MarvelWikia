As he matured and his mutant powers manifested, Tike's obsessive-compulsive disorder got worse, but he was able to hide it from most people. Joining the new, media-friendly [[X-Statix|X-Force]] as the Anarchist after the death of the popular [[Sluk]], the abrasive Tike quickly became a fan-favorite. One of the few members to survive the [[Boyz R Us]] massacre, Anarchist sought to lead X-Force, but new member the [[Orphan]] got the job instead. After losing several members on a mission to rescue [[Perez, Paco|Paco Perez]] from [[Bastrona]], X-Force recruited the [[Spike (X-Force)|Spike]], who questioned Tike's African-American roots. Around the same time, less popular team members [[Phat]] and [[Vivisector (Myles Alfred)|Vivisector]] began a public feud with the Anarchist, hoping the added press would boost their popularity. As the animosity between Spike and Anarchist grew, X-Force was hired by the U.S. government to throw a battle in space against a group of convicts mutated into the [[Bush Rangers]].  The C.I.A. hoped to jump in and make the save, but the mission went wrong, resulting in the deaths of Spike and [[U-Go Girl]], X-Force's most popular member. With her dying breath, U-Go Girl offered a new team name: X-Statix.",

With her dying breath, U-Go Girl offered a new team name: X-Statix.\n\n\nShortly after the Bush Rangers fiasco, Tike and new team mate [[Dead Girl]], a mutant zombie, began a controversial relationship.  They briefly left the team to tour together as the Death & Anarchy Roadshow. While out with Dead Girl, Tike was arrested, but his celebrity made him nearly untouchable by the authorities. Following the [[Mysterious Fan Boy|Arnie Lundberg]] and [[Bad Guy]] scandals, the Anarchist was finally named team leader of X-Statix, replacing the Orphan, who stepped down willingly. Tike's leadership was cut short when undead media sensation [[Hunter, Henrietta|Henrietta Hunter]] took over the team.  After X-Force helped Henrietta find peace by killing her murderers, she died again, and Tike resumed leadership. When X-Statix fought the Avengers over ownership of [[Doop]], Anarchist held his own against [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]].  The two teams later joined forces to fight off the Asgardian [[Fatal Sisters]], ultimately proving that Doop belonged with X-Statix. Despite the team's success, Tike began considering a solo career, and X-Statix decided to disband after one final mission. Overpowered by what seemed like a small army, the members of X-Statix all died, save the Orphan and Tike, who made a final stand. Taking off his visor, Tike charged at the enemy gunmen, who shot him down.",
