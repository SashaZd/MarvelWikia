While there, he lost all control and began slaughtering humans recklessly. [[Magneto (House of M)|Magneto]], who was in the process of cementing his hold on the world, contacted S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Sebastian Shaw (House of M)|Sebastian Shaw]] and asked them to deal with the situation. S.H.I.E.L.D. sent in the Red Army led by [[Wolverine (House of M)|Wolverine]] and they took Sabretooth down. \n\nAfter years in prison, Sabretooth was recently released into the custody of [[Magneto (House of M)|Magneto]] himself for reasons unknown.",
