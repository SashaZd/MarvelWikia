She led an investigation into the murder of several high-placed officials of the multi-galaxy [[The Charter|Charter]] enabled her to assist the short-lived group known as the [[Star Masters]].  Her exposure to Earth standards may have ultimately contributed to her rebellion against the Rigellian way, as she attempted using discourse and resistance, to encourage the abandonment of forced colonization practices.  [[image:Tana and Star Masters.jpg|thumb|Tana Nile and Star Masters|left]]She was declared a traitor by her fianc√©, the Grand Commissioner. Tana Nile returned to Earth seeking sanctuary with Thor's team of [[Avengers]]. She visited the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning maintained by subordinates of the infamous [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]. She was in the company of three juveniles, [[Richards, Franklin|Franklin Richards]], [[Artie]], and [[Leech]]. The confirmed Guardian of the Nexus of All Realities the [[Man-Thing]] and the avian-based extra dimensional adventurer [[Howard the Duck]] were also present. She underwent a series of adventures in non-linear realms which proved to be constructs of one of her companions, [[Richards, Franklin|Franklin Richards]].\n\n\t\nFollowing the destruction of over two-thirds of the Rigellian Empire by [[Thanos]], Tana Nile was reassigned as an infiltration agent on a [[Skrull]] hubworld, there she allegedly witnessed [[Ronan the Accuser]] conspire with the Skrull [[Baroness S'Bak]] to overthrow the [[Kree]] Empire's current regime.  After fleeing from the exiled and vengeful Ronan, Tana Nile found refuge on Godthab Omega with [[Gamora]] and her [[Graces]]. It was there that she fell victim to the Annihilation Wave when it assaulted Godthab Omega.  She died before she could reveal her reasons for framing Ronan.
