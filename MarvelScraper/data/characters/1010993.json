But as the world changed around her and mutants became the stars of stage and screen, it looked as if Mary Jane would be left behind, forced to perform in Off Broadway human sideshows. \n\nThat all changed when former high school friend, and world famous performer, Peter Parker asked her to play his love interest in his newest movie. The role made her America's sweetheart. Now, with the release of Funny Valentine, Mary Jane is one of the only human movie stars in the business able to launch her own solo vehicles.  \n\nBut, will mutant and human backlash for a true human movie star be too much for her to be able to succeed? She has made it this far --  much farther than most of her mutant peers would have considered possible a short few years ago.",
