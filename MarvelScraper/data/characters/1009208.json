There are different appearances and abilities for the different types of Brood. Drones are the lowest type of Brood who mostly take orders from the Queens and Empress. Drones are brown and are usually warriors. The Queens are brown, usually larger and stronger than the drones, and can expel a paralyzing liquid from their mouths. Queens may inject eggs into a host. As the eggs hatch the host becomes a Brood retaining all of the hosts knowledge and abilities. The Brood Empress is also brown and is the most powerful of the Brood. She is massive and is believed to be unable to move from her lair on the Brood's central nest world. The Empress is able to reproduce asexually by laying eggs. These eggs hatch into Firstborn. The Firstborn are green, usually larger than Queens, and are covered in super-durable bony armored plates. The Firstborn are also able to teleport, apparently through technological means and Firstborn are fierce warriors. All Brood have a psychic link to the Brood Empress.",

Devros then came to perceive himself as the Brood King, a perfect synthesis of blue-skinned Kree military facility and Brood physical prowess, and sought to similarly convert the other blue-skinned Kree while transforming the pink-skinned Kree into drones. Devros and the Brood were opposed by pink-skinned Kree [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Mar-Vell]]. Though he slew both the Brood Queen and Devros, Mar-Vell himself had been infected and began transforming into a Brood King before he was saved by Medic [[Una]], who used a modified [[Omni-Wave Projector]] to destroy the embryo within him.",
