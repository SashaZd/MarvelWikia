He named this creation Victor and left him in the care of Marianella with dormant programming preparing him for his first contact with super-powered beings on a planned trip to New York at age 18.\n\n\nMarianella kept Victor isolated on the West Coast so that he would not make contact with any super-beings, who were concentrated on the East Coast. Victor was a student at East Angeles High School in Los Angeles when he first met the [[Runaways]]. Ultron, still wishing to keep Victor's true origin a secret, sent a Doombot to kidnap Marianella and pose as Victor's father. Victor and the Runaways rushed to rescue her and the Doombot was destroyed; Ultron chose that moment to reveal himself and killed Marianella right in front of Victor. Ultron then triggered Victor's sleeper-switch so that he would attack the other Runaways; however, Gert was able to reason with Victor and he rejected his programming, defying his \"father\". Afterwards, the Runaways took the now-orphaned Victor back to their hideout to keep him from ending up in Social Services.\n\n\nBecause of his superior intelligence and electromagnetic powers, [[Talkback (Chase Stein)|Chase]] nicknamed him the Calculator Kid and [[Sister Grimm|Nico]] called him Zapper. After observing the team in action for a month, Victor proved his worth by defeating [[Swarm]] using his electromagnetic abilities.\n\n\nPresently, the Runaways are mostly friendly towards Victor, but they know that he is still a potential threat. He is often paired with Molly Hayes when the team separates to buy supplies, because [[Bruiser (Molly Hayes)|Molly]] is the only individual member of the team strong enough to take him down should he go rogue. Chase Stein is still suspicious of Victor, and resents his developing interest in [[Arsenic (and Old Lace)|Gert]]. Judging by a comment made by Nico Minoru, she is fully prepared to kill Victor if the need arises.",
