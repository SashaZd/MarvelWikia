Coming into the employ of geneticist [[Mister Sinister]], Greycrow became field leader of Sinister's [[Marauders (mutants)|Marauders]], the superhuman assassins responsible for massacring the underground mutant [[Morlocks]] community. Greycrow also shares a past with [[Gambit]] of the [[X-Men]], outside of Gambit's involvement with the Marauders, though specific details are still being collated. Though the Marauders were all seemingly killed during a [[Inferno (event)|demonic invasion of New York City]], Sinister possesses the technology to perpetually clone them from samples of their DNA.",
