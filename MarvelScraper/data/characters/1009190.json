Slaying both rapist and victim, Blackheart explored the nature of evil under his father's tutelage, clashing with and failing to corrupt [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]] and [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]]. Mephisto and Blackheart soon drew Daredevil, Brandy Ash, the genetically engineered [[Number Nine]], and [[Inhumans]] Gorgon, [[Karnak]], and [[Ahura]] into Hell. \n\nObserving these mortals led Blackheart to rebel against his father and seek a newer form of evil; in retaliation, Mephisto diminished Blackheart’s powers. Focusing on those who walked the line between good and evil, Blackheart tried and failed to recruit [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine (Logan)]], the [[Punisher (Frank Castle)]] and the [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)]] to his rebellion. Blackheart also aided [[Wonder Man (Simon Williams)|Wonder Man]] against Mephisto and helped Misha of the mercenary [[Warheads]] as her telepathic “Voice”, using [[Mys-Tech]]’s [[Rathcoole]] to obtain a mystic sword which could harm Mephisto. Returning to Christ’s Crown, Blackheart altered his followers into the [[Corrupt]], and employed Wolverine, Punisher, and Ghost Rider as a feint to allow him to anoint the sword with an innocent’s blood. He apparently slew Mephisto, banishing his “father” from Hell and restoring his own powers to full strength.\n[[image:blackheart01.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]\nAs Hell’s ruler, Blackheart focused on corrupting the Ghost Rider, aiding the [[Furies]] to possess mortal bodies to torment [[Ghost Rider (Noble Kale)]] and resurrecting the [[Scarecrow (Ebenezer Laughton)]] to send after Ketch. From his palace in the Burning Flesh district, Blackheart created his own [[Spirits of Vengeance]]: his consort [[Black Rose]] (the deceased Roxanne Simpson, ex-wife of Dan Ketch’s brother, [[Ghost Rider (John Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]), [[Verminus Rex]] (a spirit who had battled the Ghost Rider during World War I), [[Wallow]] (a homicidal mortal suicide whom Ghost Rider had thwarted), [[Doghead]] (a downtrodden immigrant), and [[Pao Fu]] (who had died in the arms of Ghost Rider as he tried to save her). Blackheart bargained to free Ghost Rider’s relatives from their curse; in return, Ghost Rider agreed to lead Blackheart’s Spirits. However, the pair fell out and Ghost Rider destroyed Blackheart, banishing him from Hell. \n\nWhile ruler of Hell, Blackheart had tormented the soul of the mutant [[Stryfe]] by manipulating the [[X-Force]] group, which attracted the attention of the mutant sorceress [[Selene]]. After banishment from Hell, Blackheart allied with Selene as the [[Hellfire Club]]'s temporary Black King. After defeating Selene's enemy [[Moy, Alyssa|Alyssa Moy]], Blackheart battled the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Mechamage]], [[Hellstorm]], and [[Szardos, Margali|Margali Szardos]]; they ultimately defeated Blackheart, binding him beneath New York's Hellfire Club. Trapped there, he continued to aid Selene, opposing X-Force in an attempt to corrupt [[Sunspot]], while awaiting his inevitable release.",
