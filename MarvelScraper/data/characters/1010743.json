Groot and Star-lord would eventually defeat the menace known as the [[Phalanx]], however in doing so Groot would sacrifice his life. The cosmic crusader [[Rocket Raccoon]] took a branch of Groot and planted it in a pot and the allowing the hero to re-grow.  While in space Groot’s only words spoken were “I am Groot”. \n\nAfter the defeat of the Phalanx, Groot joined the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] a proactive peacekeeping team assembled by Star-Lord. As a member of the Guardians Groot has battled the likes of [[Blastaar]] the living bomb-burst, the [[Badoon]], the mighty [[Shi'ar]], and the [[Inhumans]]. While in the company of [[Maximus]] of the Inhumans it was suggested that Groot's singular refrain of \"I am Groot\" actually contained a nuanced but complete ability to communicate that only those who comprehended its nuances could understand. However, it is unclear whether Groot is actual capable of communication beyond his brief statements of his identity, or if his ability to communicate is no more than a figment of Maximus's deranged mind.",
