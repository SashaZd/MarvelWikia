Otto wears special glasses to protect his damaged eyes. Octopus can mentally control his mechanical arms, even when they are miles away. Recently, it was revealed that Octavius could control metal.",

Otto seemingly co-operated until he remotely activated his arms, killed his captors and freed his fellow inmates. As de facto head of the escapees, Osborn had Otto breach S.H.I.E.L.D. security and deactivated the defenses of their Triskelion HQ. They kidnapped Spider-Man and blackmailed him into joining their attack on the White House, but the [[Ultimates (Ultimate)|Ultimates]] recaptured them and the [[Wasp (Ultimate)|Wasp]] defeated Doctor Octopus. Once more stripped of his arms, he was incarcerated in the super-prison known as The [[Raft (Ultimate)|Raft]]. \n\n\nHe later escaped again and attacked the set of \"Spider-Man: the Movie\", in order to exact revenge on his wife, Rosalita Octavius, for selling his rights to the film. When Spider-Man tried to stop him, the fight quickly moved to the Lincoln Tunnel where Octavius subdued Spider-Man, kidnapped him, and hijacked a plane going to brazil. Once there, Spider-Man ambushed Doc Ock and beat him unconcious. He was recaptured by S.H.E.I.L.D., and his tentacles were melted into slag.",
