The depowered students and staff were sent home; however their bus was bombed by anti-mutant religious zealot [[Stryker, William|Reverend William Stryker]]. Subsequently, [[Emma Frost]] had the surviving students engage in an all-in brawl, with those deemed to be the best performers assigned to a new team of trainee X-Men. Dust was among those students who made the grade.\n\nSooraya became a target of William Stryker's crusade against the Xavier Institute. Icarus gave her a note, which [[X-23]] told Sooraya not to trust. When Icarus visited the church of William Stryker he was shown why Dust was his next target. [[Nimrod (Sentinel)|Nimrod]] had a vision of an altered future in his memory banks which showed Dust killing all the [[Purifiers]] by turning into a sand storm and ripping the flesh from their bones. After entering the church of Reverend Stryker, she was shown being shot down, though it was revealed to be X-23 dressed in one of her burquas. When Stryker's team infiltrated the school, Dust reappeared, surprising Stryker and playing a key role in defeating his Purifiers.",
