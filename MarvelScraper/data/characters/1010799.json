Aron's power defeated the Fantastic Four, but he ultimately seized them for his own ends and banished the Frightful Four to the Vault.  Trying to rebuild this nearly-successful team (minus Aron), the Wizard recruited Klaw, who had freed the mutating and embittered [[Ms. Marvel (Sharon Ventura)]].  With those two and the [[Red Ghost]], who had sought out the team to join, Wizard was beaten yet again by the Fantastic Four, despite the absence of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]].  Klaw and the Red Ghost fled, so the Wizard and Ms. Marvel teamed with Trapster and a reprogrammed [[Punisher (robot)|Punisher]] (robotic “watchdog” of Galactus) to fight the Fantastic Four on [[Wingfoot, Wyatt|Wyatt Wingfoot’s]] Keewazi reservation.  When the heroic Fantastic Four seemed to be led by [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Dr. Doom]] (actually Reed trapped in Doom's armor), Wizard surrendered rather than risk Doom's wrath.\n\nThe Wizard's most recent team was a dysfunctional echo of the Fantastic Four’s family structure; including the Wizard’s half-dragon, ex-wife [[Salamandra]], and their mass-shifting daughter [[Cole]]; as well as [[Hydro-Man]] and the Trapster.  Wanting to humble the Fantastic Four on equal terms, the Wizard banished the Trapster into a time-loop after he threatened Cole, reducing his team’s ranks from five to four.  With the rebellious Cole’s aid, the Fantastic Four invaded the Wizard’s underground headquarters and defeated the Frightful Four, though the team escaped and remains at large.\n\nWizard's affiliation with [[M.O.D.O.K.]] and the [[Intelligencia]] gave way to a new version of the Frightful Four with two returning members as well as the addition of [[Lyra]], daughter of the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]]. Their first undertaking was to infiltrate the [[Baxter Building]] and kidnap Mister Fantastic. They were victorious in their mission, but they failed to eliminate the rest of the Fantastic Four because of the arrival of an unlikely ally, the [[Red Hulk]].",
