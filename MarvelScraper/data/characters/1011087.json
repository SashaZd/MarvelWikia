She can communicate telepathically with dead spirits either using their physical remains or on the astral plane and communicate with the cells, bacteria, and disintegrating tissue of corpses, temporarily resurrect the recently deceased as zombies or ghosts, and briefly summon images of deceased people from the minds of others. She has above-average strength and agility.",

Relocating to California, she became a freelance adventurer, and soon joined the publicity-seeking mutant team [[X-Force]], accompanying them into space to battle the [[Bush Rangers]], renegade government mutates. When teammate [[U-Go Girl]] died during the mission, X-Force's leader, [[Mister Sensitive]], renamed the team \"[[X-Statix]]\" per her final request. As the team reorganized, Dead Girl dated fellow member [[Anarchist]], and the two briefly embarked on a \"Death and Anarchy\" roadshow, capitalizing on Dead Girl's ability to recover from any lethal attack.",

As the team reorganized, Dead Girl dated fellow member [[Anarchist]], and the two briefly embarked on a \"Death and Anarchy\" roadshow, capitalizing on Dead Girl's ability to recover from any lethal attack.\n\nOver the next few months, Dead Girl performed X-Statix missions in Africa, Malaysia, India and elsewhere, often proving herself a savage combatant. She faced a personal crisis when telepathic messages from the dead warned that mortician [[Gutman, Brad|Brad Gutman]] was defiling corpses in his care. She killed Gutman rather than allow him to molest the corpse of his daughter Britney, then revived him long enough for him to be attacked by the ghosts of those he had assaulted. When another resurrected woman, mutant pop star [[Hunter, Henrietta|Henrietta Hunter]], joined X-Statix, Dead Girl shared her teammates' dislike of the newcomer; but after the maniac [[Mister Code]] slew Hunter, Dead Girl helped her spirit get vengeance on her original killers.\n\nX-Statix eventually decided to retire on their wealth after one final mission; Dead Girl accompanied her teammates despite an unexplained illness which ultimately re-killed her, and the rest of X-Statix were slain during the mission. Months later, the spirit of a dead super-villain known as the [[Pitiful One]] led the [[Anarchist]], [[Mysterio (Quentin Beck)|Mysterio]], [[Kraven (Sergei Kravinoff)|Kraven the Hunter]], and [[Miss America]] out of the afterlife, in forms much like Dead Girl's, to wreak havoc in New York. Needing an ally familiar with the realm of the dead to face this threat, Sorcerer Supreme [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Doctor Strange]] contacted Dead Girl, who led his astral form to recruit the spirits of [[Phantom Rider (Carter Slade)|Phantom Rider]], [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]], [[Mister Sensitive]], and others.",
