        "appearance": "Adult Shi'ar typically range from between 5 to 8 feet tall. They are bilaterally symmetric, with two legs and arms terminating with feet and hands respectively. Shi'ar hands have four independently moving fingers with opposable thumbs. Shi'ar has heads with two forward facing eyes, giving them precise stereoscopic vision. Shi'ar typically is covered in short tufts of feathers over some parts of their bodies but exhibit thicker tufts of feathers on their elbows and on top of their heads. The average Shi'ar can also lift approximately 1 ton, are slightly denser giving them enhanced durability, and endurance.",
        "distinguishing_features": "Opposable thumbs, four appendages (two arms and legs), avian features, large brains, feathers, and stereoscopic eyes",
        "technology": "The Shi'ar have advanced technology which allows them to travel through space on a vast scale, light speed transportation, teleportation technology, light based energy technology, hologram technology, cloaking technology, and Stargate space-warping technology that allows for instantaneous travel between galaxies. They also have advanced robotics, genetic, medical, and sentient technology.",

        "specieshistory": "The Shi’ar are an extraterrestrial semi-humanoid race who have established a galaxy-wide empire in the so-called Shi’ar Galaxy and have had dealing with humans from [[Earth]]. The Shi’ar originated on a planet they call [[Aerie]] (English translation) and their civilization predates Earth humans’ recorded history. Shi’ar has both avian and mammalian characteristics: for example, although Shi’ar are outwardly humanoid and mammalian in form, they have feathers instead of hair. At an earlier point in their evolution, the Shi’ar had fully developed wings attached to their arms, enabling them to fly (The current Shi’ar Empress, [[Deathbird]], is an evolutionary throwback who possesses these functional wings). Shi’ar females have mammary glands and are viviparous. Shi’ar are physically stronger than Earth humans: the average Shi’ar can lift (press) about 1 ton. Shi’ar also had twenty times the endurance of an Earth human (this difference is comparable to that between an Earth bird and an Earth human). Apparently the Aerie’s environmental conditions are similar to those of Earth, since Shi’ar can exist on Earth without artificial aids.",
