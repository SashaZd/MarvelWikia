Hence these powers are all held to a marginally inferior extent to Spider-Man's. Ezekiel possesses all of Spider-Man’s powers including his speed, agility, reflexes, and resilience. He also has the power to stick to walls and a super-human sense. He does not use web-shooters or any of Spider-Man’s other artificial tools. Because of the similar nature of their powers, neither Spider-Man nor Ezekiel can detect each other with their spider-sense. Ezekiel possesses super-human strength slightly inferior to Spider-Man. He can lift (press) approximately 9 tons.",

        "bio": "The enigmatic Ezekiel appeared seemingly out of nowhere, bearing an intimate knowledge of Peter Parker’s powers and history. Ezekiel possessed strikingly similar abilities to those of [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], although he had used them to a very different end, having built a powerful business empire with international reach. Peter was curious to discover more about Ezekiel’s past, but instead it was Ezekiel who asked the questions, suggesting to Peter that perhaps the random accident which gave him his powers was not so random and causing Peter to examine more deeply his relationship with the world of spiders from which his gifts came.\n\nIn return, Ezekiel indicated he wished simply to use his knowledge and resources to aid Peter, as Peter had aided others. This aid was soon given, when the creature named [[Morlun]] came seeking to devour Spider-Man’s totemistic powers. Soon after, Ezekiel came again to Spider-Man’s aid when [[Shathra]] the Spider-Wasp came hunting from astral plane looking to devour her natural enemy. Barely surviving these battles, Spider-Man never sought to question who might have been the true target of these attacks.\n\nTo understand more about Ezekiel, it is necessary to hear the story of Kwaku Anansi, inhabitant of Ghana in West Africa, centuries ago. Anansi sought wisdom, but also followed the way of the spider, climbing high on web and line. Anansi climbed high enough to speak to Nyame, the sky-god, and entreat with him for wisdom of the mortal world and the world beyond. Nyame demanded eternal servitude. Anansi agreed, but warned that he could never turn away from those in need and those he loved and revered. The bargain was struck and the spirit of Anansi passed down over generations to individuals with the spirit of the hunter, but who also honored Anansi’s higher ideals.\n\nSeveral years ago, the young Ezekiel learned of Anansi’s line. Using his wealth to save a Spider-Temple in Peru from planned demolition, Ezekiel demanded that the head priest Miguel should perform the blood-rite and grant the Spider’s powers to him. Miguel warned that the true heir of this generation was yet to arrive and furthermore, that the spirits of the temple would one day learn of the deception and would not be pleased. Ezekiel insisted. He always planned to first gain more power, in order to help those in need. Instead, the search for “enough” power consumed him, and he never found the moment to act.\n\nWhen Ezekiel learned of the pending arrival of Morlun and later Shathra, he knew that they were coming for him. He sought out Spider-Man and under cover of “protecting” Peter, guided Spider-Man into unwittingly fighting on his behalf. Learning of the arrival of “The Gatekeeper” and his horde of spiders, Ezekiel saw this foretold the coming of the guardian he had long feared and no such simple deception would suffice.\n\nThrough treachery, Ezekiel subdued Spider-Man and brought him to Peru. A corrupted form of the blood ritual merged his blood with Peter’s and Ezekiel then abandoned Peter to be punished in his place. Unexpectedly, the exchange worked in the both directions and Ezekiel realized the good that Peter had done in comparison to how he himself had squandered his gifts. Racing back, Ezekiel sacrificed himself to the demonic spider that sought him, leaving Peter to mourn the man with whom he had so much in common and yet so little.",
