The team began with an attack on the UCLA campus by the rogue [[Olympians|Olympian]] [[Glossary:G#god|god]] [[Pluto]], who sought to force his fellow gods Hercules and [[Venus]] (both UCLA lecturers at the time) into marrying [[Hippolyta]] and [[Ares]] as part of a plot to overthrow Olympian monarch [[Zeus]]. Hercules and Venus resisted with the aid of super-spy Black Widow, [[Glossary:D#demon|demon]] cyclist Ghost Rider, and [[Glossary:M#mutant|mutant]] heroes Angel, and Iceman. Pluto's plot was foiled, and while Venus chose to return to [[Olympus]], the other five heroes decided to remain together as a new super-team, the Champions. \n\n\nThe driving force behind the group was the wealthy Angel, who created a \"Champions, Inc.\" corporation to finance and administer the team with the aid of business manager Richard Fenster and lawyer Emerson Bale. The idealistic Angel envisioned the group as \"heroes for the common man\" who would be more accessible to the general public, though in practice they fought the same sorts of exotic menaces other super-teams did, such as mad scientist Dr. Edward Lansing's [[Super-Soldiers]] and the armored maniac [[Rampage]] (embittered engineer Stuart Clarke). Angel nominated Black Widow as team leader, a choice readily endorsed by her fellow Champions, and her old friend [[Petrovich, Ivan|Ivan Petrovich]] often assisted the group. Ivan's estranged son Yuri would attack the Champions as the [[Crimson Dynamo (Yuri Petrovich)|Crimson Dynamo]] alongside [[Griffin]], Rampage, and fellow Russian super-agents Darkstar and [[Titanium Man (Boris Bullski)]]; but the heroes triumphed with the aid of Darkstar, who switched sides and defected to join the Champions. \n\nThe [[Glossary:S#size-shifting|size-changing]] Black Goliath became an unofficial part-time Champion, serving as the team's technical adviser as scientist Bill Foster; he and other [[Stark Industries]] technicians helped design the team's high-tech skyscraper headquarters (the Champions Building) and a custom aircraft (the [[Champscraft]]), both of which proved defective due to faulty materials used by corrupt contractors. Despite their technical difficulties, the Champions battled menaces such as [[Shadow Realm]]'s Warlord [[Kaa]], [[Stilt-Man]], the [[null-life bomb]], the [[Possessor (Kamo Tharnn)]], [[Swarm]], Godzilla, [[MODOK]], [[A.I.M.]], [[Typhon]], [[Magneto (Magnus)|Magneto]], [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]], the [[Sentinels]], [[Vanisher (Telford Porter)|Vanisher]], [[Blob]], [[Lorelei (Savage Land)]], and [[Unus]], sometimes alongside allies such as [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], [[Two-Gun Kid]], the [[Stranger]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]], [[Beast (Henry McCoy)|Beast]], and the [[Avengers]].\n\nIn the end, though, the Champions were their own worst enemy: Ghost Rider and Darkstar were never fully accepted by the others, Iceman was a reluctant super-hero, Hercules was a loose cannon, and internal tensions fueled near-constant bickering until the Champions finally disbanded. Everyone quit except the Angel, who closed up shop, liquidating the group's assets; he and Black Widow later donated a repaired Champscraft to the [[Thunderbolts]] super-team. Angel and Iceman would remain friends and frequent partners, serving together in several other super-groups, some of which Angel financed. Black Widow and Hercules became lovers but soon drifted apart, though they have served together with the Avengers. Darkstar returned to Russia before her apparent death in action with the [[X-Corporation]]. The five founding Champions recently reunited to help [[X-Force]] thwart a new scheme by Pluto, but parted amicably after Pluto's defeat. Whether the Champions will ever make a lasting comeback remains to be seen.",
