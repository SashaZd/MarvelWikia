They were imprisoned in the prison planetoid known as the [[Kyln]] by the [[Galactus|World Devourer Galactus]]. The Kyln is located at the edge of the universe in a sector known as the [[Crunch Cascade]]. They remained locked in there for centuries.",

The Kyln is located at the edge of the universe in a sector known as the [[Crunch Cascade]]. They remained locked in there for centuries. \n\nUnfortunately it was through the Crunch Cascade that the [[Annihilation|Annihilation Wave]] started its invasion of the positive universe. The wave did irreparable damage to the Kyln, and Aegis and Tenebrous were released back into the living universe once more, adding further fuel to the chaos that was engulfing all life. There were two other former powerful inmates freed from the Kyln, [[Maker|Kosmos the Maker]] formerly the Beyonder, and the [[Fallen One (unrevealed)|Fallen One]] first [[Heralds of Galactus|Herald of Galactus]]. Tenebrous captured and drained the Fallen One of his power, leaving him as a lifeless husk. [[Thanos|Thanos of Titan]] came to the rescue of the Fallen One. Thanos brokered a deal with Tenebrous for the return of the Fallen One.  \n\n[[image: Tenebrous.jpg|left|thumb|100px]]Tenebrous and Aegis confronted Galactus and his newly restored Herald the [[Silver Surfer]] in battle. Galactus and the Silver Surfer were easily defeated and left for Thanos to strip them of the [[Power Cosmic]]. Thanos who had struck an alliance with [[Annihilus]] of the [[Negative Zone]]. Thanos worked diligently to remove the Power Cosmic. Tenebrous and Aegis disappeared into the cosmos. They later returned to the ruins of the Kyln hoping to find the other Proemial Gods, which could have also been prisoners there. To their disappointment they found the fallen body of [[Antiphon the Overseer]]. He had apparently fell victim to the destruction of the Kyln. The Silver Surfer who had escaped captivity tracked down the two Gods. He defeated them by using the powers of the Crunch to destroy them once and for all.",
