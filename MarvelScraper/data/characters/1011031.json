With Agency X, Alex romanced Outlaw and entered a challenge to steal the Punisher's guns.  He also encountered the young mutant [[Mary Zero]], whose power prevented everyone except Alex from noticing her existence.  Alex also roughed up the creator of Internet pop-up ads, hired [[Arcade]] to upgrade the amusement park, and clashed with the Four Winds and their new leader, Higashi. In a showdown at the park, Alex and his allies battled super-criminals hired by the Four Winds. Despite overwhelming odds, Alex and the others survived and made peace with Higashi; but only after he hired Alex to eliminate his troublesome lieutenant.\n\nSandi briefly romanced Alex while they were on an assignment to kill retired super-hero [[Fight-Man]]. Alex was then confronted by Deadpool and the Black Swan, who proposed they restore their original selves. During the transfer, the Swan betrayed them and absorbed their powers. Aided by Taskmaster, Outlaw, and hired guns from the Four Winds, Alex and Deadpool killed the Swan after stretching his newfound powers past their limit. Reforming Agency X, the mercenaries went on vacation with the Black Swan's stuffed corpse.\n[[image:agentx01.jpg|left|thumb|200px]]\n\nLater, Alex was hired to prevent Deadpool from restoring the mind of [[Cable]], who had become a would-be world savior. He was ultimately unsuccessful.",
