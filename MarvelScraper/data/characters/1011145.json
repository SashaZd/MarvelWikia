While on the prison planetoid of [[UX-73]], Hawal performed his twisted science on the inmates as torture. Several of those inmates escaped and sought there revenge on him. Among the escapees were [[Praxagora]] and [[Preak]]. They would not have the chance to get their revenge on Hawal, because he had been captured by the [[Super Skrull]] from the positive matter universe. The Super Skrull needed Hawal to make a weapon that would destroy the Harvester of Sorrows, before it destroyed the [[Skrull]] planet of [[Zarags’na]]. The Super Skrull’s only son [[Sarnogg]] was believed to be on that planet. Hawal was tortured until he made a virus that would destroy the Harvester, and then he was beheaded.",
