        "powers": "Firebird can generate heat and flame, controlling these with molecular precision. She can project heat waves, fire blasts and flame constructs; create powerful winds by manipulating air temperatures; use convection currents and thermal updrafts to carry tremendous weights aloft; and fly fast enough to achieve escape velocity. She can mentally control any heat or flame in her vicinity, and is physically immune to extreme heat and fire. Firebird has also displayed more mysterious, possibly mystical abilities. She sometimes has visions, can sense the presence of evil (especially supernatural evil), has uncanny intuition, and seems immune to demonic possession. Most remarkably, Bonita may be immortal, having proven miraculously immune to potentially fatal conditions such as the vacuum of space, a universal poison (powerful enough to kill even the Silver Surfer) and massive radiation. The Collector believes she may be one of the few beings in the universe who cannot die.",

Miraculously unharmed, Bonita discovered she now had [[Glossary:S#supernatural|supernatural]] power over flame, which she used days later to foil a convenience store robbery. Described as \"Pajaro Del Fuego\" by one of the robbers, Juarez took the costumed alias Firebird and protected the American Southwest, both alone and as a member of the short-lived [[Rangers]] team. Later, after she was attacked by the demonic [[Master Pandemonium]], Bonita tracked and fought him alongside the new [[West Coast Avengers]] roster. Eager to join their ranks, Bonita aided them against other foes such as the [[Werewolf]] and the [[Cat People]], but team leader [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] passed over her in favor of the [[Thing]].

Firebird's subsequent attempt to revive the Rangers was a failure (though she did succeed in exposing the demonic possession of her old teammate [[Shooting Star]]), and she soon left on a spiritual retreat. \n\n\nReturning in a more overtly religious guise as Espirita, Bonita helped a depressed [[Pym, Hank|Hank Pym]] rebuild his life, sharing a brief romance with him. She also helped rescue the West Coast Avengers from [[Dominus]]' time travel trap, using a message from Hawkeye entrusted to her family over two hundred years earlier. She later met [[SHIELD]] (the Society of Higher Interstellar Education and Logistical Development), a group of alien scholars who claimed the meteor that empowered her was waste material from one of their failed experiments. Bonita accepted the revelation as a lesson in humility, comforting herself with the belief that God might still be the author of her powers, albeit more indirectly than she had first imagined. \n\nResuming her original alias as Firebird, she returned to her career as a social worker and became an Avengers reservist, aiding the team against various foes such as the [[Awesome Andy|Awesome Android]], the [[Acts of Vengeance]] conspiracy, [[Atlanteans|Atlantean]] invaders, SURF, [[Morgan Le Fay]], and [[Dominex]], and helping monitor the captured [[Bloodwraith]] and an alien invasion of [[Madripoor]]. She has declined several offers of full-time Avengers membership as she is devoted to her church work, but she did temporarily join the active roster for the duration of the Kang Dynasty war, helping liberate [[Earth]] and successfully counseling a disillusioned [[Thor]].\n\nDuring the [[Civil War]] Firebird registered with the SHRA but following the news of [[Goliath (Bill Foster)|Goliath]]’s death traveled to New York and joined the \"[[Secret Avengers]]\". After Captain America’s Surrender Bonita was one of the many people who excepted amnesty and now serves the [[Initiative]] as one of the Texas Rangers.",
