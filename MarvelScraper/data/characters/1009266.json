Darkstar could thus utilize the Darkforce for various purposes. Most often, she projected it as simple mentally-controlled solid objects such as pincers, rings, columns and spheres, or as beams of solid force. If Darkstar were rendered unconscious, any Darkforce objects she constructed would dissipate. Darkstar could transport herself and up to three others by opening a portal into the Darkforce dimension and traveling through it. Because crossing through the Darkforce dimension disoriented her sense of direction, and the light of Earth blinded her for several seconds upon reemergence, traveling in this manner was risky. Darkstar could fly by generating a virtually invisible portal into the Darkforce dimension along the contours of her body without passing through it, then balancing the attractive force of the dimension against that of Earth’s gravity.",

The mutant infants were taken into custody by the state and, when their superhuman abilities first manifested in adolescence, they were turned over to [[Professor Phobos|Professor Piotr Phobos]], head of a government-run school for training Russian mutants. Given the codename Darkstar because of her mutant ability to manipulate the ebony extradimensional energy known as the [[Glossary:D#Darkforce|Darkforce]], Petrovna studied at the academy alongside her brother Nikolai, codenamed [[Vanguard]], and trained to become a government agent. \n\nAfter Phobos’s plan to drain the mutants’ powers to grant himself artificial mental abilities was discovered by the [[Starlight|Red Guardian (Tania Belinsky)]], Darkstar was dispatched to the United States alongside her lover the [[Crimson Dynamo (Yuri Petrovich)]], the [[Titanium Man (Boris Bullski)|Titanium Man]] and the [[Griffin]], assigned to capture perceived defectors the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], the [[Commissar (Alexi Bruskin)|Commissar]] and Yuri’s father [[Petrovich, Ivan|Ivan]]. Opposed by the Widow’s teammates in the [[Champions (of Los Angeles)|Champions]], Darkstar ultimately turned on the Dynamo after the truth about his father was revealed. She later deserted to the United States with the aid of the Widow’s friend [[Fury, Nick|Nick Fury]], joining the Champions. Alongside them, Darkstar faced such threats as the alien Warlord [[Kaa]], the [[Stilt-Man]], the [[Stranger]], the [[Possessor (Kamo Tharn)|Possessor]], [[Swarm]], [[M.O.D.O.K.]], [[Magneto (Magnus)|Magneto]], [[Sentinels]] and the [[Vanisher (Telford Porter)|Vanisher]]. Laynia’s teammate [[Iceman]] fell passionately in love with her, but it was a largely one-sided, unrequited relationship; as Darkstar told a bitterly disappointed Drake when the Champions disbanded, she liked him but had no romantic interest in him. After the Champions broke up, Laynia returned home. \n\nDarkstar partnered with Vanguard and a new [[Airstrike (Dmitri Bukharin)|Crimson Dynamo (Dmitri Bukharin)]] to investigate a strange, ovoid object on the Moon. There they encountered [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]] and [[Jack of Hearts]], ultimately teaming with them in opposing an attempted invasion of Earth by the alien Rigellians. Later, the trio was tricked by former Russian military General Nikolai Kutzov into believing that the U.S. was set to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against Russia, bringing them into conflict with [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] and the [[Hulk]]. They later encountered the [[Silver Surfer]] during his worldwide search for the Hulk before being dispatched to investigate the mysterious Forbidden Zone, where they were reunited with Phobos, unaware of his earlier deception. Phobos convinced the trio to join him in opposing Belinsky and her ally, the [[Presence]]. On learning of Phobos’s earlier deception, and discovering that the Presence was their father, Darkstar and Vanguard turned against Phobos and defeated him with the aid of the Hulk. Darkstar next became a pawn in a contest of champions between the alien [[Grandmaster]] and [[Death (embodiment)|Death]] herself. Selected as a member of the Grandmaster’s champions, Darkstar was teamed with American crimefighter [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]] and the Australian mystic [[Talisman]] in opposing Death’s champions [[Sunfire]], the [[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl]] and [[Iron Fist (Danny Rand)|Iron Fist]]. Later, after twice aiding the Galadorian Spaceknights Rom and [[Starshine]] against the alien [[Dire Wraiths]], Darkstar and her partners Vanguard, [[Ursa Major]] and [[Titanium Man (Topolov)|Gremlin]] worked with Crimson Dynamo to bring Magneto to justice for his crimes against Russia. A miscommunication pitted them against the [[Avengers]], who also sought to bring Magneto to trial, and the [[X-Men]], who were harboring Magneto at the time.\n\nDarkstar later embarked on a diplomatic tour of the U.S., where she and the Black Widow were targeted by Tania Belinsky, now known as [[Starlight]], as potential mates for a mentally-unstable Presence. Belinsky was quickly convinced to abandon this mad scheme. Later, Darkstar, Vanguard and Ursa Major became disillusioned with their government’s policies, and they sought to defect to America. In an effort to reclaim their “lost property”, the Russian government dispatched another team of operatives, the [[Supreme Soviets]], to return the defectors home. Disguised as the Avengers, the Supreme Soviets attacked and nearly killed Darkstar and her allies. The comatose minds of Darkstar, Vanguard, and Ursa Major then subconsciously merged into a giant bear-like Darkforce construct dubbed the “Great Beast” and attempted to kill the Supreme Soviets. After [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] convinced them to call off their attack, the trio regained consciousness and remained in America to recuperate from their injuries while the U.S. Government sought to obtain political asylum for them. These diplomatic efforts ultimately failed, and the trio was deported back to Russia. Sent to a research facility, Darkstar and her comrades were rescued by the mutant [[Blind Faith]] and his team of [[Siberforce|Exiles]], whom they joined in opposing the cyborg assassin [[Firefox]]. On a subsequent mission with the Exiles, Darkstar and Blind Faith encountered the immensely powerful psychic [[Soul Skinner]] who had taken over the small Russian town of Neftelensk. With the help of the X-Men, the Soul Skinner was defeated. Later, after the Exiles became [[Siberforce]], Darkstar’s team witnessed an attack on Earth’s moon by the intergalactic [[Starblasters]], who were searching for the mysterious power source known as the Starbrand. Investigating, Darkstar and her brother joined the cosmic Avenger [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] and other space-faring heroes in opposing the Starblasters. During the battle, Vanguard was killed by [[Threkker]], who in turn was killed by a vengeful Darkstar. Returning to Earth, Darkstar was convinced by the Presence to seek retribution against Quasar, and together they attacked and seemingly destroyed him; however, Quasar had merely used his quantum energy powers to fake his own death.\n\nSoon after, Darkstar was captured by ex-K.G.B. General Tskarov, who sought to use her power in his plot to undermine businesses along America’s east coast. Darkstar was rescued by Tskarov’s other pawns, Ursa Major and a resurrected Vanguard, and the trio teamed with Daredevil and the Black Widow to halt Tskarov’s plan. Subsequently, Darkstar was one of several Russian heroes recruited into the government-sponsored [[Winter Guard]] team, who soon found themselves defending their country against an invasion by the army of the Chinese would-be conqueror the [[Mandarin]]. After joining Earth’s heroes in opposing the alien Kree’s efforts to transform Earth into a prison planet, Darkstar and the Winter Guard became unwitting pawns in the Presence’s attempt to convert Russia’s citizens into a new, nuclear form of life. Opposed by the Avengers, those converted were ultimately restored by Starlight in exchange for [[Thor (Thor Odinson)|Thor]]’s sparing the Presence’s life. Later, Darkstar sought the X-Men’s assistance in capturing the renegade Russian mutant scientist the [[Black Death (Ivan Kirleki)|Black Death]].\n\nFollowing the establishment of the [[X-Corporation]], a global mutant search and rescue unit, Darkstar joined the organization’s European contingent based in Paris, France. On the team’s first mission opposing the threat of the bacterial consciousness [[Weapon XII]], Darkstar fell under the creature’s sway and, as a result, became an extension of the creature itself. She was shot and apparently killed by the mercenary [[Fantomex]], later revealed to be [[Weapon XIII]], and was subsequently buried in the Pére LaChaise Cemetery in Paris. \n\nRecently, Darkstar was revived with an alien techno organic virus.",
