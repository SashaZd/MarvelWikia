Rasputin thanked her for her pledge and reduced her parents to ash anyway. Unable to cope with these horrible actions, she reverted completely to her wolf form.\n\n\nAfter that ordeal, she was shipped to the [[Dark Beast]]'s labs. The Dark Beast took her on as a special project, believing that she could be his key to reverting from his bestial form to his human form. While a captive of the Dark Beast her feral abilities were pushed beyond their limits. For months she remained in her wolf state, never straying far from the Dark Beast's side in his laboratory. \n\n\nDuring the final battle with Apocalypse and after the Dark Beast teleported away in the M'Kraan Crystal, Rahne wandered the ruins of New York City in her wolf form. Discovered by [[Wild Child (Age of Apocalypse)|Wild Child]] during an X-Men patrol, Rahne was brought to [[Magneto (Age of Apocalypse)|Magneto]]. With the help of the X-Men, and the now missing Wild Child, Rahne was able to regain her transitional wolf girl form but is still unable to revert to her full human self. So far, through counseling and great effort, Rahne has been able to keep her animal side at bay, but there is always a worry that she will not be able to control herself when the X-Men might need her the most.",
