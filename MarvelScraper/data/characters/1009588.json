As a child, she had golden hair and was an occasional playmate of [[Thor (Thor Odinson)|Thor]] and his half-brother [[Loki]]. Once, while she was still an adolescent, Loki decided to play a trick on her in retaliation for her preference of Thor's company over his. As she slept, Loki cut off all of her golden hair. When she discovered the misdeed, Sif alarmed the entire capital city of Asgard with her cries of dismay. \n\n\nLoki, knowing he would be blamed for the trick, hurried to the kingdom of the Trolls to bargain with them to forge some artificial hair of pure gold to give Sif as recompense. The Trolls agreed to his terms and set about making the hair, secretly preparing it in the event that Loki tried to renege on his side of the bargain.  Loki indeed stole the hair without paying for it, and presented it to Sif. Placed on her head, the gold hair began to grow as if it were natural, shinier than before. However, because the Trolls did not have a chance to treat it with a special potion before Loki stole it, the hair began to darken, finally becoming ebony black.  \n\nWhen Sif began to cry once more, her parents began to tire of her vanity and so sent her off to learn the arts of warfare as a Shield Maiden. When she returned to Asgard years later, accomplished in the ways of the warrior, she had grown to accept her black tresses. Odin, lord of Asgard, had long deemed Sif to be a fitting mate for his son Thor, heir to the throne. Thor and Sif had seen little of one another in the millennia since their childhood when Odin deemed it time for them to renew their acquaintance. Thor had just been involved in a relatively brief relationship with a mortal [[Foster-Kincaid, Jane|Jane Foster]], and Odin was anxious to make him forget it. Soon after meeting Sif again, Thor's interest in her turned to passion, and the two became lovers and companions. \n\nEventually , they pledged to marry.  however, Thor's attachment for Earth frequently came between them.  Sif much preferred the world of the gods to the mundane world of mortals, and after attempting to adjust to Earth life on more than one occasion, returned to Asgard to live without Thor. Although Thor and Sif have not broken their betrothal, their marriage has been postponed until such time as they can reconcile their differences.\n\nLike most Asgardians, Sif is currently believed to be dead as a victim to the recent [[Ragnarok (event)|Ragnarok]].",
