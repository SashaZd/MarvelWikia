Seeking to maintain control of the Acolytes, Cortez sought to recruit Magneto’s son, [[Quicksilver]], but was opposed by his teammates in [[X-Factor]]. The Acolytes turned on Cortez after learning of his betrayal of their lord.\n\nAfter [[Professor X]] wiped Magneto’s mind, Cortez fled to the island nation of [[Genosha]] and fueled the mutant population’s revolt against the oppressive government. He took a hostage in [[Luna]], the daughter of Quicksilver, but was seemingly slain by the nigh-immortal Acolyte [[Exodus]].\n\nLater resurfacing, Cortez tricked the Magneto-clone Joseph into confronting Exodus, but his plan went awry when the Acolytes came to believe Joseph truly was Magneto. Joseph ordered the Acolytes to disband, however it was not long before Exodus reformed them, including Cortez, to oppose the enigmatic geneticist known as the [[High Evolutionary]]. Exodus sought the rare element [[Isotope E]] from the Evolutionary, but was opposed by the Evolutionary’s Knights and their then-leader, Quicksilver.\n\nCortez then led a group of Acolytes against the X-Men, but fled when the Acolytes, whose powers he was abusing during the battle, turned against him. Soon after, Magneto was ceded control over Genosha by the United Nations and offered Cortez a chance to redeem himself. Ever the schemer, Cortez accepted and became one of Magneto’s advisors. After Magneto was restored to full power, Cortez found his services no longer required and was magnetically pulled by Magneto from a prison in Hammer Bay fifty miles to Carrion Cove in less than twenty seconds. The impact killed Cortez instantly. \n\nRecently, Cortez was revived with an alien techno organic virus and  Selene's mystical powers.",
