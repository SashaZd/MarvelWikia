This and other factors led to the family to scatter around the globe, adopting a so-called \"Relative Strangers Protocol.\" The family feared that should their existence become public, they would face undue persecution and hardship. Dominic abandoned civilization and lived alone on a remote island for many years, in part due to the family rift but mostly for comfort from his superhuman senses.\n\nEventually, the existence of the family was discovered and the members began to be systematically murdered. Dominic resurrected his costumed identity and was instrumental in coordinating the other family members in defeating their enemies and in staying together as a family once again.",
