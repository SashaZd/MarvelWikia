        "bio": "Omega Flight was organized by [[Jaxon, Jerry|Jerry Jaxon]] as a counterpart for [[Alpha Flight]], the team led by his rival, [[Guardian (James Hudson)|James Hudson]].\n \n\nJaxon held Hudson responsible for ruining his career, and he correctly guessed that Hudson had become the hero Guardian. Jaxon shared this information with his new company, [[Roxxon Oil]], and Roxxon agreed to help Jaxon procure Guardian’s battlesuit, which Jaxon regarded as his own invention. [[image:Acotilletta2--Omega Flight 1.JPG|left|250px|thumb|Guardian confronts Omega Flight]] Their help included the use of their robot, [[Courtney, Delphine|Delphine Courtney]]. Working together, Jaxon and Courtney formed Omega Flight ([[Box (Roger Bochs)]], [[Diamond Lil]], [[Flashback]], [[Smart Alec]], and [[Wild Child]]), recruiting the team from agents formerly part of the Canadian government's [[Department H]] training grounds for Alpha Flight before the program was shut down. \n\nOmega Flight confronted Alpha Flight at the Edmonton Mall, beginning a protracted battle. Jaxon surprised Guardian by appearing in control of the Box armor, and the two fought single-handedly. Jaxon died when Guardian caused Box to explode, creating a feedback of electricity. Unfortunately, Guardian himself appeared to die after the battle, his battlesuit exploding from irreparable damage.  \n\nDelphine Courtney reorganized the Omega Flight, this time wearing a battlesuit similar to Guardian's. Using her disguise to lead Alpha Flight into a trap, Omega Flight was defeated with the help of the mutant [[Jeffries, Madison|Madison Jeffries]], who destroyed Delphine Courtney with the use of his powers to control metal. \n\nYears later, a new Omega Flight was formed, this time under the leadership of the [[Master of the World]]. The Master foresaw an invasion of the alien [[Ska’r]], He formed the group largely so that he would have ready shock troops at his command. Sure enough, the Ska’r attacked, starting their invasion in Canada. At the same time, the [[Magus (Adam Warlock)|Magus]] launched his own [[Infinity War|invasion]] of Earth, using evil doppelgangers of heroes. The Master was content to let the aliens ravage Canada, regarding its casualty an acceptable and unavoidable cost in order to defeat the Magus later. When [[Beta Flight]] appeared to stop the Ska’r, the Master ordered Omega Flight to stop them, and he was eventually forced to involve himself directly as well. Beta Flight, under the direction of [[Windshear]], was able to rout Omega Flight and the Ska’r, although the Master believed this would only pave the way for the Magus, teleporting himself and the team away.  \n\nMonths later, the Master launched a plan to usurp control of the Canadian government, using the identity Joshua Lord. When Alpha Flight confronted him, he had not only Omega Flight to protect him but also the Antiguard, a reconditioned [[Guardian (James Hudson)]] that he discovered in a dimension of null space after one of his supposed deaths. The Master rebuilt Hudson's body, brainwashing him into his slave and using him alongside Omega Flight to destroy his enemies. In fact, Omega Flight nearly succeeded in destroying the Alphans, until Hudson's wife and teammate [[Vindicator (Heather Hudson)|Vindicator]] managed to reach her husband and he turned on the Master. The Master disappeared after his defeat, and the final fate of the members of Omega Flight remain unrevealed. \n\nWhen the [[Civil War|Superhuman Registration Act]] became law, various villains and unregistered heroes began to cross into the Canada to escape the SRA. This caused a problem for the Canadian government due to Alpha Flight demise. [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]] agreed to help the Canadian government by sending a group of registered heroes to Canada. [[Sasquatch (Walter Langkowski)|Sasquatch]] and [[Talisman (Elizabeth Twoyoungmen)|Talisman]] teamed up with [[Arachne (Julia Carpenter)|Arachne]], [[Guardian (Michael Pointer)]] (formerly known as the Collective), and [[U.S.Agent]] to form the new Omega Flight in order to fight a horde of demons, a [[Tanaraq]] possessed Sasquatch, and the [[Wrecking Crew]]. They also got assistance from extraterestial known as [[Beta Ray Bill]] who had taken the task of guarding those demons Wrecking Crew freed. During the battle that followed Beta Ray Bill tricked the demon hordes to follow him into a dimensional portal, once inside the portal Guardian destroyed it trapping Beta Ray Bill and the demons in another dimension. For this act of bravery Beta Ray Bill was granted honorary membership on the team. Despite Bill sacraficing himself, Omega Flight still remains together.",
