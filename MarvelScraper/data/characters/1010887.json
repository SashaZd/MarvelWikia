Together, they became known as the [[Wrecking Crew]].\n\nAfter their first foray against the [[Defenders]], Bulldozer and the Wrecking Crew were inseparable, appearing with them in all their endeavors, including their abduction to [[Battleworld]] by the [[Maker|Beyonder]] and joining with [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]]'s army of super-villains. The Crew also joined [[Baron Zemo (Helmut)|Baron Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil]] and Bulldozer was instrumental in helping bring down [[Hercules (Heracles)|Hercules]]. After this, Thor used his hammer to draw the Wrecker’s away from the others who divided it, and Bulldozer was left powerless. \n\nMonths later, the Wrecker freed his Crew and restored their power once more. As before, wherever the Wrecking Crew was to be found, Bulldozer was among their number. They performed many other acts of villainy, although they had to deal often with the treachery of Thunderball, who craved the Wrecker’s power all for himself. Eventually, the Crew reconciled, seeking out Hercules once more. But battling them helped Hercules overcome the fear of combat he had suffered since the  beating at their hands, and they were defeated. \n\nOnce, their powers began fading when many of [[Asgard]]'s links to Earth were separated. The entire Crew received a power boost when hired by [[Zola, Arnim|Arnim Zola]] to battle the [[Thunderbolts|Thunderbolts]] (unaware that the Thunderbolts included many of their former allies in the Masters of Evil).  \n\nThe Wrecking Crew appeared together for various endeavors: hired by the likes of the [[Doomsday Man]], battling heroes such as the Avengers and the [[Warriors Three]], used as lackeys by [[Morgan Le Fay]], among others. When the Crew was imprisoned in the [[Raft]], they joined the massive breakout and escaped.",
