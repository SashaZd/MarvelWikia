Terrified and in pain, Elvin ran home to his only family, Granny Staples, and she nursed him back to health over a period of days.

During that case, Elvin met the [[New Warriors]], who befriended him and later convinced him to help them steal an Avengers [[Quinjet]] for an emergency rescue mission. Expelled from the Avengers for this misconduct, Rage joined the New Warriors, becoming a mainstay of the group and forming a close friendship with Speedball. When the Poison Memories gang killed Granny Staples as part of a vendetta against the Warriors, Rage cold-bloodedly killed gang leader [[Ashu, Kimeiko|Kimeiko Ashu]], though a judge later deemed his actions self-defense. \n\n\nWarriors leader Dwayne Taylor ([[Night_Thrasher]]) and Dwayne's mentor [[Chord, Andrew|Andrew Chord]] were appointed Elvin's legal guardians, and when Dwayne later had a falling-out with the other Warriors, Elvin left the team with him. Serving as mentors to the troubled super-youths [[Psionex]] for a time, Night-Thrasher and Rage eventually rejoined the Warriors, who began to drift apart as their members pursued differing goals. Rage has decided to concentrate on his studies at the Oatridge School for Boys and is only infrequently active as a super hero of late, though he has been willing to assist the Avengers and the Warriors against foes such as the [[Elements of Doom]], [[Morgan Le Fay]], [[Whirlwind]], [[Taskmaster]], [[A.I.M.]], Lord Templar and an insane [[Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff)|Scarlet Witch]].",
