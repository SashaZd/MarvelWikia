        "powers": "Scrambler is a mutant who possesses the superhuman ability to generate a disruptive form of energy that alters the function of any system he touches, whether that system be that of a living being, a machine, or a field of energy. Scrambler must physically touch his target with his bare flesh in order to affect it. Scrambler can control this power to vary the effects it has. If he touches a living being, Scrambler can cause immobilization, unconsciousness, or death. If his victim possesses superhuman powers, Scrambler can disrupt the function of those powers, most often causing them to overload and flare out of control. Scrambler can also cause machines to malfunction or cease operation altogether. Scrambler's power works on a 1:60 time ratio. Hence, if he touches something for one second, the effects of his power last for a minute (sixty seconds). Obviously, if he induces death, the effect is permanent.",
