In the company of those three, Susan fled Molekevic and used her invisible protective force field to take them back to the surface.\n\nMaking the study of herself and her three partners her new life's work, Sue spent months investigating their abilities and charting their powers while improving her own understanding of herself. She has deduced the nature both Reed and [[Human_Torch (Ultimate)|Johnny's]] changes, though her own powers remain unexplained and she is unable to penetrate [[Thing (Ultimate)|Ben's]] skin with any more detail than determining his internal fluid pressure. Sue continues to develop her force fields, though there are physical side effects to extreme usage. When [[Doctor_Doom (Ultimate)|Van Damme]] attacked the Baxter Building with a squad of flying insects, Susan contained a squad of them with a force field, developing a nosebleed in doing so, and later caught a crashing helicopter in her force field, suffering severe physical stress.\n\nSusan has proven capable of standing on her own, and after the team went public, she assumed the codename \"Invisible Woman.\" Her force fields have been the Four's ace in the hole, saving their lives when [[Nihil]] dumped Reed and Ben into the near-vacuum of the N-Zone and single-handedly stopping the time-traveling Chrono-Bandits. She co-created the chrono-tunnel with Reed, and has conducted biological studies of the Kree alien [[Mahr Vehl (Ultimate)|Mahr Vehl]] and extra-dimensional life in the N-Zone.\n\nThough her new found fame has brought her unsought attention from the likes of billionaire playboy [[Iron_Man (Ultimate)|Tony Stark]] and the Atlantian criminal [[Namor (Ultimate)|Namor]], she remains romantically attached to Reed despite her concerns about his over devotion to science.",
