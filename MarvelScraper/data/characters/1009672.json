The Gremlin believed that no one would find him in his base Bitterfrost, due to his loses to the Hulk there. Thinking he was safe Gremlin mocked the Iron Man and even the KGB. The KGB and the Crimson Dynamo had set up listening devices in his bunker and waited for Iron Man to strike. Iron Man, using his stealth suit, broke into the base unnoticed by the automated defenses outside. Luckily the Crimson Dynamo did not and was attacked by the defenses distracting Tony long enough for him to sneak into the Titanium Man suit. Shutting his defenses off, Titanium Man went outside and fought Iron Man. With the Crimson Dynamo's suit incapacitated the Titanium Man grabbed Iron Man. Being crushed by his hug Iron Man tried to break free but instead caused his jet boots to combust the titanium in Gremlin's armor burning him to death in the process.",
