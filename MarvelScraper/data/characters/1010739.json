However, this new incarnation of [[X-Factor]] has no relation with the U.S. government, as the previous teams.\n\nJamie Madrox expanded the agency in the wake of [[House of M]]--adding [[Siryn]] and [[M (Monet St. Croix)|M]]--and began to investigate the mutant Decimation. [[Rictor]], suffering from feelings of doubt and depression from no longer being a mutant, was pushed off the roof of a building by one of Jamie's dupes. After M saved Rictor from the fall, Jamie was able to convince him to join the agency as well.\n\n[[Miller, Layla|Layla Miller]] added herself to the team as a way to prevent X-Factor Investigations from discovering the truth behind Decimation. The team soon learned the story despite her efforts, and subsequently took a public stand against the Superhero Registration Act. \n\nIn order to help the X-Men learn about the future following the birth of the first mutant baby since the Decimation, Madrox sent two duplicates into the future with Forge's help. Against the plan, Layla Miller joined one of the duplicates and ended up in the future timeline in which [[Bishop]] grew up. They were interned in a mutant camp, where Layla killed the duplicate in order to send his memories back to the original Madrox. She is still trapped in that timeline. \n\nWolfsbane left the team following the battle over the mutant baby and joined [[X-Force]], though X-Factor Investigations doesn't yet know where she is.",
