He is believed by some to be the father of the space pirate [[Nebula]], who is a Luphomoid as well. It has been rumored throughout the galaxy that Nebula was a descendant of the Mad Titian [[Thanos]]. This rumor has not been solidified by any known facts; Thanos himself has not confirmed this actuation either. Spirit was inspired by the exploits of Thanos, she saw him as someone worthy of her respect. This admiration was due to his allegiance to [[Death (embodiment)|Mistress Death]]. Spirit sought her own death, but it could only be at the hands of someone worthy of the feat. Her killer had to be an actual avatar of Death. For unknown reasons, her own avatar is either identical to or actually is [[Death Metal]], the third generation of the Minion series of cyborgs, which were created in an alternate future time-line on Earth 8410, including [[Death Wreck]] and [[Death's Head (Minion)|Death's Head]], each of whom had a number of adventures across time, space, and dimensions. They were all partially constructed from the Promethium, which derived from spawn of the genocidal [[Charnel]] of Earth 9939. Death Metal constantly struggled to keep his blood-lust under control.",

They were all partially constructed from the Promethium, which derived from spawn of the genocidal [[Charnel]] of Earth 9939. Death Metal constantly struggled to keep his blood-lust under control.\n\nDuring his adventures in the universe (Reality-616) Death Metal arrived on the planet Glutam seeking peace and solitude, only to be attacked by the [[Psycho-Warriors]] of the [[Techno-Wizards]] of [[Mys-Tech]] who sought to claim Death Metal as a weapon of their own. Observing the object of her worship being attacked by the Psycho-warriors she joined in the battle. After she defeated the last of Psycho-Warriors she knelt before Death Metal in hopes that he would slay her. Death Metal became annoyed with her behavior and, teleported away.  The fanatic Spirit quickly leaped through the portal. She followed him to the planet of Gnap, where he was being attacked by [[Brassknuckles]] a warrior created an employed by an unidentified source, Brassknuckles also sought to end his own existences by goading Death Metal into killing him. Fearful that Brassknuckles might kill her death avatar, Spirit skewered Brassknuckles with her staff. The attack failed to kill him. Death Metal manipulated the Techno-Wizards into using sufficient force to destroy him, but at the last second he reintegrated himself upon learning that they planned to exterminate the innocents of the mining colony of Xcydrin. Death Metal recruited both Brassknuckles and Spirit to help save the colony, and they stayed together for many adventures after that, Spirit kept hope that Death Metal would reward her by taking her life, or she would die by the hands of one worthy being in the process.\n\nSpirit became separated from Death Metal and Brassknuckles under unrevealed circumstances, Spirit was then led to the planet of [[Godthab Omega]]. While on this planet Spirit joined, [[Gamora]] the deadliest woman in the Universe, as one of her [[Graces]]. In the company of Gamora and the other Graces, they conquered and ruled Godthab Omega. Their rule ended when [[Annihilation|Annihilation Wave]] hit the planet, Spirit was slain, and it is safe to say that she would have found [[Annihilus]] as a worthy death  avatar.",
