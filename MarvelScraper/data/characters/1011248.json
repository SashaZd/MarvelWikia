The surge of radiation gave Delilah the ability to copy any nearby [[Glossary:S#superhuman|superhuman]] being's powers derived from exposure to [[Glossary:G#gamma radiation|gamma radiation]]. Although some abilities can be beneficial, Delilah found out how detrimental hers can be. As a gamma powered serial killer ran rampant throughout the streets of New York, Delilah began having dreams of his exploits – dreams that were actually the killer's thoughts, and she was literally seeing events through his eyes. A sighting of the murderer brought the NYPD and their superhuman consultant, [[Doc Samson]], to the scene. Samson tackled the suspect head-on and captured the supposed perp, but it turned out the prisoner was actually Delilah whose powers physically and mentally transformed her into the shape of the deranged killer, [[Patchwork (Kyle Barker)|Patchwork]].",

Samson tackled the suspect head-on and captured the supposed perp, but it turned out the prisoner was actually Delilah whose powers physically and mentally transformed her into the shape of the deranged killer, [[Patchwork (Kyle Barker)|Patchwork]]. \n\nSamson knew there was something more to his captive, and once he discovered her secret, he had her copy his gamma patterns in order to bring her to her senses. Now imbued with super strength, and the confidence to go with it, the young woman now dubbed Geiger was ready to help capture the actual Patchwork. Geiger became the best candidate to track Patchwork because she was still attuned to his gamma signature, but her inexperience almost led to an early retirement for both her and Samson. However, with the help of [[She-Hulk]], [[Polaris]], and some dumb luck, Patchwork's civilian identity was established, and he was soon brought into custody. Afterwards, Samson gave Geiger a lock of his hair to help keep her steady if she ever picked up any bad gamma signals. \n\nSome time later, Geiger was considered to be a good recruit for the [[Initiative]] by [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]] and was taken into the program. Alongside other trainees, Geiger was defeated at the hands of KIA, but she helped to battle the [[Skrulls]] during their [[Secret Invasion|attempted take over of Earth]].",
