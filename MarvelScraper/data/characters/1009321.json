        "bio": "The fiercely proud Gladiator is the leader, or praetor, of the Imperial Guard, a multi-ethnic group of super-powered alien beings who act as enforcers of the laws of the Shi'ar Empire.  Gladiator was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman [[Glossary:M#mutant|mutant]] adventurers known as the [[X-Men]] who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix [[Neramani, Lilandra|Lilandra]] from her insane brother, then-Majestor [[Neramani, D'Ken|D'Ken]].  Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the [[Starjammers]] arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor.\n\nThe Guard and the X-Men subsequently clashed once more when the Shi'ar sought to end the threat to the universe posed by the cosmic entity known as the [[Phoenix Force|Phoenix]], which had assumed the form of X-Men member [[Jean Grey]].  As praetor of the Guard, Gladiator was an obvious choice to be one of eight Guardsmen chosen to battle the X-Men.  The Guard defeated the X-Men on this occasion, but the mutants were allowed to return to Earth after Phoenix seemingly committed suicide.\n\nGladiator was later amongst those few Imperial Guard members who opposed the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by [[Deathbird]].  Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Samédàr, Gladiator remained steadfast in his loyalty to then-Empress Lilandra.\n\nLater, Gladiator travelled to Earth in an effort to capture a spaceship of renegade members of the shape-changing [[Glossary:A#alien|alien]] [[Skrulls]]. Mistakenly thinking the Skrulls had disguised themselves as members of the world-famous [[Fantastic Four]], Gladiator attacked and defeated the super-hero family.  When the Skrulls, posing as X-Men, then appeared, Gladiator was irritated on having his \"friends\" attack him.  Together with the help of the web-slinging [[Spider-Man]] and the super-soldier named [[Captain America]], the Skrulls treachery was exposed and they were quickly captured by Gladiator.\n\n[[image:gladiator01.jpg|thumb|left|180px]]\nWhen the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne from her sister Lilandra in a successful coup, Gladiator was forced to swear fealty to his new empress, even though his loyalties still lay with Lilandra.  However, Gladiator's sense of duty saw him continue to serve as the Guard's praetor, despite his personal feelings about his new empress.\n\nSoon after, when a member of an alien race that had been forced to join the Shi'ar Empire came into possession of armor belonging to the Spaceknight of Galador, the Imperial Guard mistakenly attacked the Spaceknight named [[Rom]].  After the misunderstanding was made clear, Rom and Gladiator teamed up to face the culprit, and Gladiator came to realize that even though the Shi'ar provides their conquered species with everything, they lack one important thing - freedom.\n\nGladiator subsequently led the Imperial Guard against the British team of costumed adventurers known as [[Excalibur]] and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named [[Marvel Girl (Rachel Summers)|Rachel Summers]], whose power Deathbird sought for herself.  After Deathbird was struck down whilst siphoning Phoenix's power, Gladiator ordered the Guard to retreat, thus robbing Deathbird of the chance to become supremely powerful.\n\nMuch later, the intergalactic teleporter [[Cheney, Lila|Lila Cheney]] transported the X-Men to the Shi'ar Empire at the behest of then-Empress Deathbird in time to see Lilandra regain her throne.  Not all was as it seemed, however, as in reality a group of Warskrulls, using technology to allow them to duplicate superpowers, had captured and impersonated [[Professor X|Xavier]], using his [[Glossary:T#telepathy|telepathy]] to control Lilandra and the Imperial Guard, including Gladiator.  After the ruse was discovered by the X-Men and all the Warskrull impostors were exposed, Lilandra settled matters with Deathbird, discovering her sister did not want the throne anymore.\n\nDuring the war between the Shi'ar and [[Kree]] Empires, Gladiator sought to stop the team of super-powered Earth beings known as the [[Avengers]] from becoming embroiled in the conflict.  He clashed with both the ionic energy-powered [[Wonder Man (Simon Williams)|Wonder Man]] and the Norse god of thunder, [[Thor (Thor Odinson)|Thor]].  However, Gladiator had met his match with Thor, who brutally rendered Gladiator unconscious and then hurled him through one of the Shi'ar's transportational stargates, sealing it behind him.\n\nWhen Lilandra learned of the many Earth heroes that had sacrificed their lives to stop the malevolent [[Glossary:P#psionic|psionic]] being named [[Onslaught (entity)|Onslaught]], she dispatched eight members of the Imperial Guard, including Gladiator, to protect Earth.  While on Earth, the Guard uncovered a plot by a militant Kree faction to simulate a radical political activist group in revenge for Earth's involvement in the Kree/Shi'ar war.  In reality, the group created a \"nega-reactor\", similar to the bomb that was used on the Kree.  However, this plot was stopped by the Guard, but not before the reactor was used by the Kree's leader, the [[Supreme Intelligence]], to re-incorporate itself after being presumably killed at the end of the war.\n\nDuring their brief stay on Earth, Gladiator and his fellow Guardsman [[Oracle]] learned that a fugitive from Shi'ar justice was hiding on the planet, stuck in the form of a child and with no memory of his former life.  Their search brought them into confrontation with the gamma-spawned man-beast known as the incredible [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]].\n\nSubsequently, Gladiator was amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree [[Ronan]] the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the [[Inhumans]].\n\n[[image:gladiator02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Attacking the X-men Mansion]]\nAfter his Empress Lilandra, under the mental control of Charles Xavier's mutant twin sister [[Nova, Cassandra|Cassandra Nova]], had ordered the destruction of all mutants on Earth, Gladiator led the assault team that attacked the X-Men's mansion home. Defeating both [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]] and the [[Beast (Henry McCoy)|Beast]], Gladiator was halted by the arrival of his fellow Guardsman [[Smasher (Vril Rokk)|Smasher]] who managed to convince the Guard of the true threat.  Together, the Guard and the X-Men managed to defeat Nova and free Lilandra.\n\nGladiator recently returned to Earth under the command of Empress Lilandra in a mission to capture the cosmic Uni-Power and bring it back for evaluation. After a battle with the [[Invisible Woman]] of the Fantastic Four, who had been possessed by the Uni-Power and transformed into [[Captain Universe]], the Uni-Power transferred over to Gladiator so he could rush the Invisible Woman to Los Angeles to help prevent an impending tsunami. Afterwards, Gladiator invited the Uni-Power back to the Shi'ar Empire as their guest. The Uni-Power accepted; however, en route they were captured by Krosakis, an energy consuming warlord, who forced the Uni-Power into his body to become a corrupt Captain Universe. Drained of his energy, Gladiator and others could only watch as Krosakis toiled away with the Uni-Power. However, the [[Silver Surfer]] sensed the Uni-Power's distress and, following a prolonged battle with Krosakis, saved the Uni-Power and Krosakis' prisoners. The Surfer, imbued with the Captain Universe powers, left for Earth while Gladiator took Krosakis to the Shi'ar Empire to stand trial.",
