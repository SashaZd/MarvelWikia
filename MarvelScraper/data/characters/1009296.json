Monty foretold of the coming of the alien Messiah (S'met'kth), potential destroyer [[Tiamat]] and its potential protector [[Mithras]]. Monty eventually proclaimed mercenary \"[[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]]\" the predestined Mithras. Zoe studied Wilson's life, becoming obsessed with earning a promotion through the \"Mithras Directives.\" Years later after Dixon became the Overboss, Monty deemed Wilson increasingly unlikely to become Mithras, and Zoe investigated. She befriended Wilson's girlfriend [[Copycat|Vanessa Carlyse]] (later Copycat) and developed sympathy for the unlikely couple. When Wilson failed an assignment, his client targeted Vanessa, but Zoe saved her life. She returned to LL&L, but Monty revealed that Wilson, having contracted cancer, would leave Vanessa.",
