        "weapons": "Nuke used an enormous sub-machine gun nicknamed \"Betsy\" in his missions.  Besides conventional machine gun ammunition, Betsy also held six light artillery rounds and two incendiary missiles.  On Betsy's side Nuke used an LED counter to count the number of fatalities he had inflicted with his weapon.  Nuke also had an unmarked military helicopter for air support, operated by an unnamed colonel.",

Nuke's adrenaline is raised when the keyword 'No V.C.' is chanted to him, which sends him into a fury since the word had been developped into a trigger word in Vietnam.",
