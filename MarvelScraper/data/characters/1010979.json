        "bio": "Ororo Munroe was a goddess. Following the rise of [[Apocalypse (Age of Apocalypse)|Apocalypse]] the continent of Africa was in disarray. Storm rose up and declared herself the Windrider. She carved out a small area of Africa as her own and intended to keep it safe from the strife of the war between humans and mutants. \n\nUnfortunately this just drew attention to her and her people. Apocalypse attacked the Windrider's new nation and brought it to its knees. He captured Ororo and intended to make her one of his Horseman. He had her branded and put in the care of [[Sinister (Age of Apocalypse)|Sinister]] and the [[Dark Beast|Dark Beast]], instructing them to make her into a warrior of Apocalypse. He named her Storm. \n\nWhile in the Dark Beast's labs Storm was tortured and subjected to the mind-warping telepathy of the [[Shadow King (Age of Apocalypse)|Shadow King]]. Able to fight off his telepathy, her struggle summoned a storm of such great strength that power across Apocalypse's lands was knocked out. In the power loss, a sympathetic Prelate [[Cyclops (Age of Apocalypse)|Scott Summers]] helped her escape. Storm headed for Africa. \n\nIn Europe, she was confronted by [[Quicksilver (Age of Apocalypse)|Quicksilver]] who she assumed was an operative of Apocalypse but was actually a member of the X-Men. Quicksilver eventually earned her trust by turning his back and telling her he trusted her. She momentarily considered frying him but didn't. The two of them would eventually become more than friends. \n\nWith the X-Men, Ororo kept the name Storm to remind her of what she had been through and joined [[Magneto (Age of Apocalypse)|Magneto]]'s fight. She was selected to be part of Quicksilver's X-Men squad sent to aid the Sentinels created by the Human High Council to help evacuate North America in Maine. While there, the team was confronted by the Brotherhood and their leader, the Horseman known as [[Abyss (Age of Apocalypse)|Abyss]]. Storm helped Quicksilver save a boy Abyss had kidnapped in an attempt to draw Quicksilver out into the open.\n\nAfter the evacuation was complete the X-Men returned to their hideout in Westchester. There they discovered Apocalypse had attacked and captured Magneto, his son [[Lensherr, Charles (Age of Apocalypse)|Charles]], and [[Bishop (Age of Apocalypse)|Bishop]]. Storm accompanied Quicksilver to the Temple of the [[Madri (Age of Apocalypse)|Madri]] to save the mysterious man known as Bishop. They successfully rescued Bishop and also freed Jamie Madrox, the man responsible for the Madri Cult. Madrox shut down his own mind to prevent the Madri from surviving.\n\nStorm accompanied the rest of the X-Men to New York City to confront Apocalypse and defeat him. They were successful. Since then, Storm and Quicksilver have furthered their relationship while continuing to fight for Magneto's dream of coexistence.",
