Charles gradually realized Erik, now calling himself [[Magneto (Ultimate)|Magneto]], didn't share his goal of peaceful coexistence with humanity. When Charles and his allies fled the Brotherhood, Magneto impaled Charles with a metal spear, severing his spine. \n\n\nAs the Brotherhood turned to terrorism, Charles worked to oppose them. Offered funding for a mutant school and hospital by the [[Hellfire Club (Ultimate)|Hellfire Club]], Charles asked Moira to take charge of the latter, ensuring that his sickly son David had constant treatment. At some point, Charles romanced his adult student [[Frost, Emma (Ultimate)|Emma Frost]], who eventually left him after arguing against what she viewed as plans to turn his students into soldiers. When the government launched the robotic anti-mutant Sentinels in response to the Brotherhood's terrorism, Charles sent his new students, the [[X-Men (Ultimate)|X-Men]], to save mutants from the killer robots. The X-Men rescued the President's kidnapped daughter from the Brotherhood, winning Presidential favor, which was augmented when they saved Washington from destruction and Charles apparently slew Magneto.  Charles secretly spared Erik, rendering him an amnesiac in the hope of eventual rehabilitation. \n\n\nWhen David went on a murderous rampage, Charles found himself unable to kill his son, so [[Colossus (Ultimate)|Colossus]], one of his X-Men, did it for him. Feeling himself a failure for letting down both David and his student [[Iceman (Ultimate)|Iceman]] (whom David hospitalized), Charles nearly disbanded the X-Men. Apparent progress with Magneto's rehabilitation convinced him to persevere. Tragically, Magneto later regained his memories and returned to terrorism. Suspected of collusion because he had lied about Magneto's demise, Xavier was captured by [[Ultimates (Ultimate)|the Ultimates]] and imprisoned in Camp X-Factor in Guantanamo Bay. Later freed in a Brotherhood raid, he coordinated efforts to contain a nuclear power plant meltdown Magneto instigated, publicly redeeming himself. The X-Men were allowed to continue under S.H.I.E.L.D. jurisdiction.",
