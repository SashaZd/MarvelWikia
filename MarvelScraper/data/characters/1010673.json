Amphibian can also see through the murky depths of the ocean and has some form of telepathy allowing him to communicate with marine life such as dolphins. He can presumably travel at great speeds while in the water, but the exact speed is unknown. Outside of water Amphibian has superhuman strength allowing him to lift ten tons and his skin is superhumanly tough.",

As Amphibian, he was one of the founding members of the [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Squadron Supreme]]. Amphibian resigned in protest over the Squadron's behavior modification program and chose to live underwater where he was completely uninvolved and unaware of the surface world.\n\nWhen the Squadron returned from their adventures in [[Earth-616]], they set about reuniting all of the surviving founders of the Squadron. [[Power Princess (Earth-712)|Power Princess]] brought Amphibian back to [[Utopia Isle]] where he rejoined the Squadron. Amphibian went with the Squadron to attack the [[Global Directorate (Earth-712)|Global Directorate]], and were joined by [[Nighthawk (Neal Richmond) (Earth-712)|Neal Richmond]], the new Nighthawk.\n\nAmphibian and the Squadron continued their battle against the Global Directorate and were on the verge of being captured by the Global Directorate's Blue Eagles when [[Proteus (House of M)|Proteus]] arrived on Utopia Isle having run from the [[Exiles]]. Proteus (in the body of [[Marvel 2099 (Earth-928)|Earth-928]]'s [[Hulk (2099)|Hulk]]) quickly helped the Squadron Supreme defeat the Blue Eagle troops and convinced the Squadron to attack the Exiles when they arrived. Proteus then teleported to another reality while the Exiles arrived on [[Earth-712]]. The Exiles were quickly defeated by the Squadron and were put on trial for supposed crimes against the multiverse. Amphibian and the Squadron were shown the truth of the Exiles mission by [[Sasquatch (Exiles)|Heather Hudson]] who used the [[Timebroker (Exiles)|Timebroker]] interface. Hudson also showed Amphibian and the Squadron the truth of the Global Directorate's rise to power, and the Exiles helped the Squadron overthrow the Global Directorate's oligarchy.",
