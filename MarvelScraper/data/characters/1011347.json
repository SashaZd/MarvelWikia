Instead she was bombarded with radiation. Not quite herself, May Parker bit Peter on the head and passed out. Peter suddenly found himself transformed into a pig like May, yet still retaining his spider-like abilities. When May Porker came to, the accident must have scrambled her brains a bit since she seemed to have no memory of Peter ever being a spider. Taking the last name \"Porker\", Peter then became her nephew and May was none the wiser.",
