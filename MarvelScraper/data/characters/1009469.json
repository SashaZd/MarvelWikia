She can fly via finlike wings, secrete corrosive acid or paralyzing toxin from her hands, and change her skin color as camouflage. Namorita ages extremely slowly, even by Atlantean standards; nearly a half-century old, she appears to be in her twenties.

Llyra assumed the throne of Lemuria soon after, and Namorita remained in her care, suspecting her of Namora's death but unable to prove it.\n\nIn recent years, Llyra plotted against [[Namor]] and forced Namorita to lure Namor into a trap. Namor foiled their plans and, reunited with the cousin he had not seen since her infancy, he entrusted her welfare to his longtime surface friend, [[Prentiss, Betty|Betty Prentiss]]. Under Prentiss's guidance, Namorita attended high school and college, and she took Prentiss's last name following her guardian's death. Namorita herself acted as mentor to the alien Wundarr, and when he attained adult intelligence as the [[Aquarian]], she briefly joined his spiritual movement, the [[Water Children]].\n\n[[image:namorita01.jpg|thumb|left|205px]]When the alien menace [[Terrax]] surfaced, Namorita and other superhumans defeated him and joined forces as the [[New Warriors]]. After some time with the Warriors, Namorita was shocked to learn of her cloned nature. Reassured by Namor, she fell in love with teammate Nova, only to undergo a physical transformation into a more primitive and powerful form of Atlantean. Eventually regaining her original appearance, she and [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] grew apart, and she later dated the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] of the [[Fantastic Four]], although that relationship also ended. At present, she co-rules Atlantis with Namor and the warrior [[Andromeda (Andromeda Attumasen)|Andromeda]].\n\n\nRecently, during a televised raid by the New Warriors of a building in which [[Cobalt Man]], [[Speedfreak]], [[Coldheart]], and [[Nitro (Robert Hunter)|Nitro]], who had recently escaped from the [[Raft]], resided, Namorita followed after Nitro. Slamming him into a bus, Namorita taunted him, but Nitro screamed he wasn't the kind of loser that she was used to facing and that she was in fact \"playing with the big boys now\", before letting off a massive explosion that killed Namorita, [[Night Thrasher]], [[Microbe]], Cobalt Man, Speedfreak, Coldheart, all of the children at the nearby elementary school, and all residents in the surrounding neighborhood where the fight took place.",
