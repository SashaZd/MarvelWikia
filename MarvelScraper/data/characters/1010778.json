[[Fury, Nick|Nick Fury]] then recruited Wendell for S.H.I.E.L.D.‘s Super-Agent program.\n\nDuring a trip into space to learn the origins of the Quantum bands, Quasar was contacted by [[Eon]], the guardian of Cosmic Awareness. He appointed Quasar the Protector of the Universe (inheriting the title from the now deceased Mar-Vell ([[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]) and charged him with the task of preventing his murder. Quasar failed to save Eon, but stopped his killer, [[Maelstrom]] from collapsing the universe into a giant black hole.\n\n[[image:quasar01.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Quasar with the Fantastic Four]]\nQuasar had long been an admirer of the Avengers and was honored when [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] asked him to join the team. However he found that his duties as Protector of the Universe prevented him from giving the team his all. When the creature known as Ego attempted to swallow up the Earth into itself, Quasar absorbed Ego into his Quantum Bands. To guard against Ego being released, Quasar has been forced to exile himself into space. Quasar has encountered many super humans including [[Makkari]], [[Deathurge]], the [[Blue Shield]], [[Firelord]], [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Squadron Supreme]], the [[Stranger]], [[Jack of Hearts]], [[Moondragon]], and many others.\n\nWhile battling the Annihilation Wave alongside [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]], Quasar was killed by [[Annihilus|Annihilus]]. The Quantum Bands--and the mantle of Quasar--were then transferred to [[Quasar_(Phyla-Vell)|Phyla-Vell]].",
