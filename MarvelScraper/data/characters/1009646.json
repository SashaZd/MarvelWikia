Primary among her powers is the ability to command the Spirits of the Land, meaning she is literally part of the Spirit World itself.",

        "bio": "Elizabeth Twoyoungmen was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, the daughter of [[Shaman|Michael Twoyoungman]] of the Canadian superhero team [[Alpha Flight]]. She became estranged from her father at the age of four following the death of her mother following an illness. Michael, a physician, had promised to save her and his failure led Elizabeth to be bitter and resentful toward him.\n\nAs a college archeology student, Elizabeth was excavating the site of the original Fort Calgary when she discovered a skull. When she touched it an apparition appeared that only she could see. Frightened, she sought out her father, whom she recognized as Shaman despite a spell he had cast to prevent himself from being so recognized. Together they investigated the skull, determining that it was the source of ancient anger or ancient evil.\n\nMeanwhile, a young woman named [[Emily Strang]] was tending to her great-grandfather, [[Lucas Strang]], when she was attacked by a mystical force manifesting itself through scrambled eggs (eggs being both a symbol of new life and a symbol of potential life unfulfilled). Shaman and Elizabeth traveled to the site of the manifestation and Shaman seemingly defeated it. However, the force again manifested itself, this time through Lucas, and possessed Emily. As the possessed Emily attacked Elizabeth, Shaman identified it as [[Ranaq]] the Devourer, one of the Great Beasts of the North. Under Ranaq's barrage, Elizabeth found herself growing stronger until she was able instinctively to turn the force of Ranaq's attack back against it. Shaman launched an attack on Ranaq as well and together they drove the beast out of Emily, saving her life. Shortly thereafter, Elizabeth reached into Shaman's mystical medicine pouch at his bidding and withdrew a coronet (later identified as the \"[[Coronet of Enchantment]]\"). Placing it on her brow, she was transformed into Talisman, with the power to manipulate vast magical energies and command the spirits of nature to do her will. Talisman joined with Alpha Flight, only to be horrified to later learn that she was unable to remove the Coronet without enduring unbearable, agonizing pain.\n\nAfter joining the [[Omega Flight]] team Talisman, discovered that she was not as powerful as she once was. Her current level of power and the reason for its diminished level drop is still unclear.",
