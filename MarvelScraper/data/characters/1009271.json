        "bio": "Destiny was apparently born into a wealthy family in 19th Century Austria. After her mutant power first developed, it nearly overwhelmed her with visions of the future. She spent over a year transcribing these visions into books, after which she was left physically blind.\n\nSeeking to understand what she’d written in her diaries, Destiny contacted the shape-shifting mutant detective [[Mystique|Raven Darkhölme]] to aid in her quest, and the two eventually became longtime companions and lovers. After traveling for a time with a carnival as their fortuneteller, Destiny worked as an archivist at the [[Black Womb]] genetic project. The pair also lived together whilst Raven was raising her unofficial foster daughter, the young mutant named [[Rogue]].\n\nAfter Raven became Mystique, Destiny helped her form the team of super-powered terrorists the [[Brotherhood Of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. However, Mystique eventually tired of her team being hunted as outlaws, and offered their services to the U.S. Government in exchange for a pardon for their crimes, becoming the government-sanctioned [[Freedom Force]] team. On their first official mission, they were dispatched to capture the self-styled master of magnetism, [[Magneto (Magnus)|Magneto]].\n\nLater, during a clash with the criminal cyborgs the [[Reavers]] on [[Muir Island]], off the coast of Scotland, Mystique left Destiny in the care of the mutant technosmith [[Forge]], however Destiny sent him to assist Freedom Force in repelling the Reavers. Then, as she had foreseen, Destiny was killed by the telepathic mutant [[Legion (David Haller)|Legion]], who was being controlled by the powerful psychic [[Shadow King]].\n\nDestiny’s body was later cremated and her ashes scattered out to sea by Mystique, however her consciousness apparently survived inside Legion’s mind, and he interpreted her words as a need to kill Magneto to preserve the dream of his father, [[X-Men]] founder [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]. Instead, he accidentally killed Xavier himself, creating an alternate timeline. Legion was killed after reality was repaired, and his ghost co-existed with Destiny’s in [[Limbo]] where they worked with the sorceress [[Szardos, Margali|Margali Szardos]] to secretly protect humanity.\n\nLater, the X-Man [[Pryde, Kitty|Shadowcat]] discovered one of Destiny’s diaries, and, for a time, a splinter group of X-Men scoured the world for rest of the “[[Books of Truth]]” to prevent the revelations they contained from falling into the wrong hands. \n\nRecently, Destiny was briefly revived with an alien techno organic virus.",
