His power was granted to him by the [[Hawk God (Earth-691)|Hawk God]] of Arcturus. He was a vastly powerful cosmic being embodying the predatory nature of existence. The Hawk God's influence and actions were often destructive, but they fulfilled a greater universal purpose. His fellow cosmic beings felt that he was power-crazed, excessively violent and gratuitously cruel. The cosmic being known as [[Eternity (Earth-691)|Eternity]] brought charges against the Hawk God for causing the near-total extinction of the [[Watchers (Earth-691)|Watchers]]. The Hawk God was tried before the council of cosmic equals and the [[Living Tribunal]] performed the position of judge. The Hawk God was prosecuted by the last surviving Watcher, [[Ulig (Earth-691)|Ulig]], and defended by the world devourer [[Galactus(Earth-691)|Galactus]] who sympathized with the Hawk God's predatory nature.

[[image:Quasar and Kismet of the 20th Century.jpg|thumb|Starhawk's parents, Quasar and Kismet of the 20th Century|left]]\nThe Living Tribunal declared the Hawk God dangerous, partly because he was thought to be a likely instigator of the long-prophesied reality-threatening War of the Cosmic Beings. The Hawk God was sent back to the planet Arcturus IV, around Earth's early 20th Century. He was among the gods worshiped by the early Arturians, and they constructed a 30' robotic computer in his likeness. Upon his demotion, the Hawk God was trapped in this immense replica, in an inactive state. \n\n\nThe humanoid Arcturian race is presumed to be violent and unstable, this trait is thought to be a side effect of the constant daylight, due to the planet having twin suns. They measure their lifespans in centuries instead of years. The Acrturians also practice genetic engineering. This practice ended in a planet wide nuclear war. \n\nStarhawk recently returned, changed to a female form and later sacrificed his life to save the current Guardians team.",
