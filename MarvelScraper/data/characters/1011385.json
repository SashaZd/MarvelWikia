Ramsey succeeded in initiating communications with Warlock, and both joined the New Mutants. Ramsey was code-named Cypher, after his ability to decipher languages.\n\n\nCypher became close with Warlock, who aided Ramsey in battle situations by merging with him, creating a single being that operated as a gestalt. When they merged, they took the form of Ramsey’s human body covered with Warlock's \"living circuitry,\" allowing Ramsey to perceive his environment in the same way Warlock did. At first, Ramsey's and Warlock's consciousnesses remained separate within the single body; the more the pair merged, their personalities rapidly began to resemble one another's. Cypher also aided Warlock in his fight against his father, the [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]], by reprogramming the Magus to an infant state.\n\nFollowing the capture of the New Mutants by the mad scientist the [[Ani-Mator]], on the island known as \"Paradise\" in the Atlantic Ocean, Cypher was killed when he dove in front of a bullet fired by the Ani-Mator at [[Wolfsbane]]. One of the [[Phalanx]], humans mutated by the Technarch, later took a form combining the minds and powers of Cypher and Warlock, as Douglock, and later [[Warlock (Technarchy)|Warlock]]. \n\nRecently, Cypher was revived with an alien techno organic virus. Later he rejoined the New Mutants.",
