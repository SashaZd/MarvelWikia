The mutants Magneto and his aide Fabian Cortez apparently negotiate with an unknown force to bring the infection to Earth-2149 and so reduce the human population, although this backfires when mutants also prove susceptible. It is revealed via Marvel Zombies: Dead Days and Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness that the plague was brought to this Universe via a zombified Sentry who came through a realm thought by Ash Williams to be the gates of Heaven. The Sentry, after flinging Ash into this Universe, continues to fight this realms Avengers, biting them and therefore starting the infection.",
