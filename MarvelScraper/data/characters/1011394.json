One such time was when [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]] was a fugitive, hunted for supposedly murdering a high-ranking senator.\n\nFury hired the Shiver Man to bring the fugitive Wolverine directly to him instead of S.H.I.E.L.D.  The Shiver Man tracked Wolverine and [[Beast]] to a parking lot outside a small rural town, and comensed to attack them, sensing that Wolverine was guilty of the murder.\n\nRetreating after losing his left arm, the Shiver Man begins to rethink his strategy, only to lose his quarry to a corrupt faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. led by Agent Brent Jackson.\nFury later summoned Shiv to trail Jackson and dig up some dirt on him; but Fury would have never guessed just how dirty Jackson was.\n\nJackson had Wolverine broken out of the Cage by [[Sabretooth]], currently a member of the [[Weapon X|Weapon X Program]], and brought with an injured Beast to the new Weapon X facility.  There, the Shiver Man staged a daring rescue, destroying the facility, killing inumerable grunts (with the help of Wolverine), destroying the Program's files on all past Weapon X empolyees and test subjects, and entering into a pitched battle to the death with Sabretooth (which was kind of pointless, since each could recover from nearly any wound imaginable), which Shiv won.\n\nHowever, feeling that, because the Weapon X Program had been controlling Wolverine's mind during the murder, his guilt should be alleviated, yet still haunted by his curse to avenge innocent blood, the Shiver Man dissipated before he could confront Wolverine again.",
