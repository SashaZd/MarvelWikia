Santo was among those students who made the grade. When the New X-men decided to destroy Nimrod once and for all Rockslide was obliterated in the battle. Hellion,used his telekinetic powers to piece him back together only larger and more rugged than his previous form.He sucessfully aided in defeating nimrod sending him back in time, Rockslide was later seen talking to [[Match]] and [[Anole]] about their abilities and how useful or unuseful they would be if they joined the New X-men team.",
