        "bio": "Graduating from New York City's police academy with top honors, Misty Knight became a patrolwoman at the Twelfth Precinct in partnership with Rafe Scarfe. Early in her career, she rescued [[Wing, Colleen|Colleen Wing]] from a Manhattan gun battle, and the two soon became best friends. Sometime later, Misty encountered terrorists attempting to bomb a bank; she retrieved the bomb, but it exploded before she could dispose of it. Her right arm had to be amputated and was replaced with a cybernetic limb designed at [[Stark International]]. Despite the enhanced strength of her new arm, Misty's injury removed her from active patrol duty, and she resigned rather than accept a desk job. Depressed over these developments, she was encouraged by Colleen to again take an active role in life, and the two eventually became partners in a private investigation firm, Nightwing Restorations.\n\nMisty first met [[Iron Fist (Danny Rand)|Iron Fist]] when Colleen, who had already befriended him, was abducted by his enemies; erroneously believing Iron Fist responsible, Misty attacked him but soon learned the truth, then helped him against his enemies. Misty and Iron Fist became romantically involved. When he founded [[Heroes for Hire]] with [[Cage, Luke|Luke Cage]], she and Colleen, known as the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] for their martial arts skill, frequently aided them.\n\nDespite their close relationship, Misty eventually became estranged from Iron Fist; she began dating police officer Tyrone King, who unknown to her was actually Iron Fist's mystical enemy [[Master Khan]] in disguise. Unknown to either, Iron Fist was subsequently replaced by the extradimensional plant race known as the [[H'ylthri]], and Khan arranged for the disguised alien [[Super-Skrull]] to murder the surrogate Iron Fist; the grief-stricken Misty soon broke ties with \"King.\" Later, the Super-Skrull impersonated Iron Fist himself, and although his deception was exposed, the non-human nature of Iron Fist's corpse was also revealed, as was Khan's scheme. Accompanied by [[Sub-Mariner|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], Misty and Colleen traveled to Iron Fist's home city in the dimension of K'un Lun, where they rescued him from imprisonment by the H'ylthri. Misty and Iron Fist renewed their relationship, and she aided him during his efforts to rebuild Heroes for Hire, but afterward drifted apart.\n\nHiring secretary Penny O'Neal, Nightwing Restorations took on several low-profile clients. Wing worked undercover as a performer at Circus Vandenberger to expose Rudy Vandenberger's scheme to take over the family business through acts of terrorism. Knight and Wing next reunited kidnapping victim Shana \"Tok\" Peters with her parents. Knight and Wing also apprehended Ron Tatum, a former heavyweight boxer living in Brooklyn who physically assaulted his wife Ann, a childhood friend of Knight. With business slow, Knight began working as a paralegal for the law firm of Nelson, Murdock & Sharpe, while Wing offered Cage work as an operative for Nightwing Restorations, but Cage declined. Knight then teamed with [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], Cage, and Iron Fist to defeat [[Venom (Mac Gargan)|Scorpion]], who had kidnapped [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. After the battle, a distraught and disillusioned Iron Fist disappeared on a world-spanning quest to find meaning for himself. The Daughters followed him to the Himalayas, saving him from a wolf pack. Along with his mentor, [[Kung, Lei|Lei Kung the Thundere]]r, the Daughters accompanied Iron Fist to [[K'un-Lun]], where he defeated a resurrected [[Steel Serpent (Davos)|Steel Serpent]] and regained direction in his life.\n\nShortly after Iron Fist reestablished Heroes for Hire as a larger mercenary organization funded by Namor's Oracle, Inc., the Daughters were hired to help the team apprehend biotechnician/geneticist Professor Wolfgang Hessler, a powerful bio-weapon creator operating out of St. Eboar’s Monestary in Symkaria. Unwittingly manipulated by the Master, the Daughters and their allies soon battled [[Silver Sable]]'s [[Wild Pack]], which was protecting Hessler. Although the Master ultimately obtained Hessler’s technology, the Heroes for Hire defeated him, but at a great cost to Iron  Fist. Soon after, the Daughters participated in a mystic ceremony conducted by [[Brother Voodoo (Jericho Drumm)|Brother Voodoo]] to replenish Iron Fist's lifeforce. Alongside Iron Fist and Cage, the Daughters were next hired by CEO Getulio Villa-Lobos to protect DaCosta International's San Francisco office from [[Reignfire]], whom Villa-Lobos believed to be Roberto DaCosta ([[Sunspot]]). Knight was later attacked by the New Men's [[White Tiger (New Men)|White Tiger]], Iron Fist's Heroes for Hire teammate, who was jealous of Knight's relationship with Iron Fist, but Knight convinced the Tiger she could not win Iron Fist's love by eliminating the competition. Next, Wing accompanied Heroes for Hire to [[Madripoor]] to investigate allegations of piracy in the South China Seas and helped defeat Lionmane (Lo Chien), the Chinese general secretly in charge of the piracy operation, and his associates -- the [[Cat (Shen Kuei)|Cat]] and Sai. Later, the biochemist [[Nightshade]] (Tilda Johnson) broke into Nightwing Restorations, defeated Wing and obtained the cremated remains of Black Dragon’s head, which she used to resurrect the monster. When Cage was critically injured during [[Fury, Nick|Nick Fury]]'s Secret War, Knight and Wing provided protection alongside Iron Fist while Cage recuperated at the Night Medical Center, a treatment facility for street level superheroes.\n\nKnight and Wing have since become bail bonds-women, lending bail money to apprehended street level super-villains until their cases work their way through the criminal justice system. If the super-villains miss their scheduled court dates, Knight and Wing become bail enforcement agents, also known as bounty hunters, concerned solely with bringing their fugitive clients back to justice. Nightwing Restorations recently hired indestructible mutate [[Johnson, Otis|Otis Johnson]] as an administrative assistant. Knight and Wing recently investigated [[Ricadonna, Celia|Ricadonna]], a wealthy New York publishing mogul and rising crime lord suspected of involvement in the deaths of several Nightwing Restorations' clients who inadvertently stole a microchip containing a computer virus capable of destroying the world economy. In a sword fight between Knight and Ricadonna, Misty lost her bionic arm. [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Tony Stark]] outfitted her with a state-of-the-art arm. Aided by Iron Fist and the insect-controlling criminal [[Humbug]], Knight and Wing raided a secret auction for the microchip, and brought Ricadonna to justice.\n\nKnight went on to form a new version of the Heroes for Hire, along with Colleen, for the purpose of apprehending those who refused to comply with the [[Civil War|Superhuman Registration Act]]. They were backed by Stark and their roster included old faces as well as some new ones like the [[Black Cat]], [[Shang-Chi]], [[Orka]] and the new [[Tarantula (Maria Vasquez)|Tarantula]]. Together, the group found themselves face-to-face with those they considered allies like [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] as well as enemies such as the [[Headmen]]. Ultimately, the Heroes for Hire suffered more than they triumphed due to betrayals, death and losing themselves somewhere along the line, so the team disbanded. After a rocky relationship with Iron Fist, she eventually reconciled with him and even saved his life on a few occasions. Once Iron Fist returned from a near-fatal journey to [[The Eighth City]], Misty revealed to him she was pregnant with his baby. \n\nDuring the time [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]] decided to lord over New York City's Hell's Kitchen as leader of the [[Hand]], Misty investigated several Hand-related murders. The victims were all known felons, but she wanted to make sure Daredevil wasn't using the ninjas as a hit-squad. Silver Sable, Paladin and the [[Shroud]] were all involved in similar investigations, so they decided to pool their resources. They discovered that several police officers led by Misty's old partner, Rafael Scarfe, were posing as ninjas, framing the Hand for the murders they were committing. Misty was hospitalized for injuries she received and was told she had a false pregnancy, causing her to end her relationship with Iron Fist.\n\nShe established herself as \"Control\" and started Heroes for Hire once again. She was kidnapped by [[Puppet Master]] and placed in an artificially induced coma while he used new technology, filtered through her bionic arm, to recruit and enslave several heroes. Misty's will proved to be too strong, and she resisted the drugs keeping her sedate, but her awakening almost got her killed by a mind-controlled [[Punisher (Frank Castle)|Punisher]]. She severed Puppet Master's hold on every hero he managed to manipulate but was unable to find out anything else because Punisher shot Puppet Master, leaving him in a coma. Misty was ready to shut down Heroes for Hire, but Paladin convinced her to keep going on her terms and maybe find out who truly orchestrated her kidnapping.",
