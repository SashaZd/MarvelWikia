At times, Rourke has been romantically involved with her X-Force teammate James Proudstar, a.k.a. [[Warpath]] and Deadpool. Rourke is an alcoholic, but is believed not to have consumed alcohol in several years at this time. After her stay with X-Force she left them to join the team of [[X-Factor Investigations]] in [[Mutant Town]].  During her time with X-Factor, her father was killed while trying to save an airplane full of innocent civilians.

Recently, her teammate and love interest Jamie Madrox had a very drunken night where he ended up sleeping with Siryn and one of his dupes sleeps with their other teammate M. Since that eventful night, Siryn has found herself to be pregnant.",
