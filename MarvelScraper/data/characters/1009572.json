Though the Squad was defeated, Jones remained under the Crown's influence, using corporate resources to create his own Serpent Squad: [[Sidewinder (Seth Voelker)]], [[Black Mamba]], [[Death Adder (Roland Burroughs)|Death Adder]], and [[Anaconda]]. This project also created solo operative [[Bushmaster (Quincy McIver)]], and may have empowered [[Asp (Cleo Nefertiti)]], [[Cottonmouth]], and [[Rattler ]] as well. The new Squad acquired another Serpent Crown for Jones, escaping after his defeat.\n\nForming the Serpent Society, a snake-themed criminal group built on a business model, Sidewinder invited his fellow Roxxon serpents plus Asp, Cobra, the [[Constrictor]] (who declined), Cottonmouth, [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], Princess Python (soon fired for cowardice), Rattler, and Viper (who ignored them). The Society offered its members impressive benefits, notably escape from prison via Sidewinder's teleportation powers. After some initial trials, the group advertised its services to a number of institutions before assassinating [[M.O.D.O.K.]] for [[A.I.M.]] Shortly thereafter, Death Adder was assassinated by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]]. \n\nViper arranged the public arrest of serpent-criminals [[Black Racer]], [[Copperhead (Davis Lawfers)|Copperhead]], [[Fer-de-Lance]], and [[Puff Adder]]. Sidewinder took this bait and recruited them, but they turned on the Society and Viper took over the group with the help of [[Boomslang]], [[Coachwhip]], [[Rock Python]], and [[Slither]]. Only Black Mamba, Asp, Diamondback, and Bushmaster remained loyal to Sidewinder. Diamondback contacted [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]], who stopped Viper's scheme, but Viper herself was defeated by Cobra, who betrayed her. Disheartened, Sidewinder left the group. The Society was briefly employed by the [[Deviants|Deviant]] [[Ghaur]] to recover certain mystical totems, but when the group was defeated by the [[X-Men]], Sidewinder intervened to complete the mission himself.\n\nCobra (now King Cobra) assumed leadership, the Society having added Viper's snakes, excepting her and Slither. Diamondback left to pursue a romance with Captain America, and a suspicious Cobra demanded she betray the Captain to prove her loyalty. She refused, and was nearly executed before Black Mamba, Asp, and Sidewinder rescued her. When Cobra went after Mamba and Asp, the Society was defeated by Diamondback, [[Paladin]], and Captain America. Mamba and Asp left briefly to form [[B.A.D. Girls, Inc.]] with Diamondback and [[Impala]]. Sidewinder also reformed, agreeing to prison time in exchange for Captain America's guarantee of care for his ailing daughter. The Society moved to Arizona but was tracked there by [[Jack Flag]], who defeated them alongside [[Free Spirit]] and [[Force Works]].\n\nUsing stolen Roxxon technology, the Society equipped new Sidewinders. One such Sidewinder was killed in the employ of [[Deathsting]], trying to steal the [[Zodiac  Key]] from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]; another Sidewinder has since been seen in action. With these Sidewinders allowing Cobra to free imprisoned members again, the group resurfaced. The reunited Serpent Society recently fought Captain America to capture a Diamondback who was revealed to be a [[Glossary:L#LMD|Life Model Decoy]].",
