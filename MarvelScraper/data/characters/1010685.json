        "bio": "The Nextwave Squad was created by General [[Anger, Dirk|Dirk Anger]], the Director of [[H.A.T.E.]] (Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort) as an elite anti-terrorism team. The team leader is former [[Avengers]] member (and leader) [[Rambeau, Monica|Monica Rambeau]], something which she constantly reminds her teammates of.\n\nThe Nextwave squad found out that H.A.T.E. was actually getting its funding from the Beyond Corporation, a subsidiary of the S.I.L.E.N.T. terrorist cell, their direct enemies. So they stole the Shockwave Rider and took off. This highly experimental aircraft is inexhaustibly powered by the classified Zero Point Squirt drive, containing five tesseract zones.\n\nThey began to battle the Beyond Corporation and their U.W.M.D.s (Unusual Weapon of Mass Destruction) hidden across America. Their first enemy was [[Fin Fang Foom]], angry at its inability to find a mate. He started to destroy the city of Abcess, North Dakota. The Nextwave team sent [[Machine Man|Aaron Stack]] inside to destroy him from the inside, since his hide was too strong to damage from the outside. \n\nThe next U.W.M.D. was in Sink City, Illinois. The Ultra Samurai Seed infected a corrupt policeman named Officer Mac Mangel. This U.W.M.D. transformed its new host into a giant metal-eating Samurai Robot, gaining in size the more it ate. Tabitha destroyed the Samurai Robot, and Officer Mangel was released and left at the mercy of the local townspeople (who were not so generous).",
