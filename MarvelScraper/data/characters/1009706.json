Even after the ploy was discovered, Warstar, like most of the other Guard members present, still chose to side with Samédàr against the X-Men who were defending then-Empress [[Neramani, Lilandra|Lilandra]].\n\nMuch later, during the war between the Shi'ar and [[Kree]] Empires, Warstar was amongst an advance team of the Imperial Guard who were dispatched to Earth to discover the whereabouts of the powerful Kree weapon known as the Omni-Wave Projector. During the mission, Warstar clashed with members of the team of super-powered Earth heroes known as the [[Avengers]] and the team of intergalactic freebooters known as the [[Starjammers]].\n\nWarstar was also amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree [[Ronan]] the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the [[Inhumans]].\n\nFollowing a meeting of the intergalactic council, Earth was declared a threat to the entire cosmos and consequently it was deemed to turn the planet into an intergalactic prison.  Criminals from numerous alien races were teleported to Earth, among them the former Imperial Guard members who had allied themselves with Deathbird and Lord Samédàr all those years ago, including Warstar.  These former Guardsmen had allied themselves with a lone member of the alien D'bari, calling himself [[Starhammer]], who sought revenge on Jean Grey for the crimes of Dark Phoenix.",
