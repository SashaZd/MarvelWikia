In addition, he can override electrically powered devices and manipulate them mentally, travel along conductive surfaces (such as power lines) at speeds as fast as 140 mph, create electrostatic \"bridges\" to travel varying distances and disrupt Spider-Man's ability to cling to walls. When fully charged, however, Electro becomes extremely sensitive to anything that can \"short circuit\" his abilities, particularly water.",

However, after being convinced by his mother that he was not smart enough to pursue such a career, Max instead reluctantly took a job as a lineman for an electric company.

Instead of being killed, the freak accident caused a mutagenic change in his nervous system, allowing him to generate and control vast amounts of electricity. After creating a colorful costume, Max turned to a life of crime as Electro.\n\nAt the beginning of Electro's criminal career, [[Jameson, J. Jonah|J.Jonah Jameson]] began a smear campaign in the [[Daily Bugle (Building)|Daily Bugle]] proclaiming Electro to actually be an alter-ego for Spider-man. Intent on proving the publisher wrong, Spider-man faced Electro and was nearly killed by merely touching him. Using a fire hose, however, the web-slinger was able to defeat Electro. Sometime later in another attempt to deface Spider-man's reputation, Jameson secured Electro's supercharged services to battle the web-slinger on national television. Before an audience of millions, Spider-Man stood triumphant once more. Dillon was humiliated.\n\n[[Image:Electro03.jpeg|thumb|200px|left]]After a string of embarrassing defeats, decided to test his strength in numbers as a member of the [[Sinister Six]], alongside [[Doctor Octopus (Otto Octavius)|Doctor Octopus]], [[Kraven (Sergei Kravinoff)|Kraven the Hunter]], [[Sandman (William Baker)|Sandman]], [[Mysterio (Quentin Beck)|Mysterio]] and the [[Vulture (Adrian Toomes)|Vulture]]. Drawing numbers, the plan was for each villain to face Spider-man in a different location that drew upon their respective talents one by one until one of them was victorious. However, they were eventually defeated and imprisoned.\n\nIn an attempt to win himself the glory and respect that had alluded him so frequently, Dillon tried to devise a master plan to control New York City's power supply. However, he was once again defeated by Spider-man and convinced to quit his criminal career...if only temporarily. He resurfaced as a member of the next incarnation of the Sinister Six, with [[Hobgoblin (Jason Macendale)|Hobgoblin]] replacing the deceased Kraven the Hunter. Doctor Octopus betrayed the group and they were subsequently disbanded. \n\nElectro was also a member of Mysterio's Sinister Seven, created to combat Spider-Man's insane, homicidal clone, [[Kaine]]. However, Kaine disappeared and with no further need to keep the group together, it was disbanded and Dillon returned to his self imposed exile  \n\nHe was once again brought out of retirement by the [[Rose (Jacob Connover)|Rose]], who offered Dillon the chance at an experimental procedure to greatly enhance his abilities in exchange for his services as an underworld enforcer. Dillon and agreed, sensing the opportunity to rise above his past failures. After undergoing the procedure and dispatching several members of the True Believers, an offshoot of the [[Hand]] at the request of the Rose, Dillon returned to his original plan of taking over the New York City power supply. Once again defeated by Spider-Man, who had donned an insulated suit, a frustrated Dillon threw himself into the Hudson River, apparently killing himself. \n[[Image:Electro02.jpeg|thumb|200px|left]]\nHowever, Dillon survived as he reappeared as part of the next series of subsequent incarnations of the Sinister Six, each of which were either defeated or disbanded due to internal conflicts. The most recent incarnation, the [[Sinister Twelve]], gathered by the [[Green Goblin (Norman Osborn)|Green Goblin]] as part of a larger plan to enable his escape from prison and destroy Spider-Man. They were defeated with the help of the combined efforts of [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]], [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]], [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]], [[Yellowjacket (Henry Pym)|Yellowjacket]] and the [[Fantastic Four]].\n\nElectro was hired by [[Brainchild]] to free [[Sauron|Karl Lykos]] from the Raft, a maximum-security prison designed to hold supervillians. Electro initiated a prison break the likes of which had never been seen, releasing scores of criminals. However, his actions also brought together a number of the world's most powerful heroes to contain the disaster including: Captain America, Iron Man, [[Cage, Luke|Luke Cage]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], Matt Murdock, [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] and Spider-Man, many of whom were trapped in the [[Raft]] when the power was shut off. With the exception of Daredevil (and Sentry at first), this impromptu gathering of heroes reunited shortly after the prison break to form a new [[Avengers]] team. Dillon tried to escape with his girlfriend, a waitress in Boston, but was captured by the new Avengers, the very team he inadvertently helped create.",
