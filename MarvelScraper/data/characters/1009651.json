Galactus sent his sometimes-adversaries of the [[Fantastic Four]] to apprehend Tyros and bring him to receive the [[Power Cosmic]]. Tyros resisted them, but to no avail. Galactus made Tyros his new Herald Terrax, and the power cosmic magnified his abilities, making him far more powerful than he had been before.\n\nTerrax proved to be the most troublesome Herald to ever serve Galactus. Although he led to devour many worlds, Terrax wished to use his powers for personal gain, and only fear of his master kept him in line. He once fled Galactus' service to set up his own empire, but Galactus empowered the [[Earth]] woman, [[Dazzler (Alison Blaire)|Alison Blaire]] (also known as Dazzler) to retrieve him. Finally, Terrax kept Galactus from feeding long enough that his energies dwindled, and he finally led him to Earth in the hopes that the Fantastic Four would help him slay his master. Galactus withdrew the power Cosmic from Terrax to replenish his own spent energies, and left Terrax stranded on Earth.\n\nThe dictator [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Victor von Doom]] was able to restore some of Terrax's power to him to use against the Fantastic Four, but in battle with the [[Silver Surfer]], Terrax was consumed by the Power Cosmic and killed. His body later regenerated itself on Earth, but the Surfer exiled Terrax to an uninhabited world.\n\nTerrax was released from his exile to aid fellow Heralds [[Firelord (Pyreus Kril)|Firelord]], [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]], the android [[Air-Walker (Gabriel Lan)|Air walker]] and the Silver Surfer against [[Morg]]. Terrax slew Morg with his own axe, which he kept as spoils of the battle, Morg was later resurrected.\n\nAs the [[Annihilation|Annihilation Wave]] began its search for Galactus' Heralds so that [[Annihilus]] could study the Power Cosmic, Terrax was one of the first to be captured by the [[Seekers]] of Annihilus and taken into custody. Terrax was eventually freed from his captors' control and exacted his revenge upon them. Afterwards, he, [[Paibok|Paibok, the Power Skrull]] and the [[Infant Terrible]] journeyed to a world inhabited by [[Centaurians]] and saved them from the deadly [[Space Parasite]]. After cleaving the monster in two, Terrax left the others planet side claiming it was time for him to show the universe why Terrax, the Tamer should be feared once more.\n\nRecently, the [[Red Hulk]] recruited Terrax, along with [[Tiger Shark]] and [[Baron Mordo]], to become part of the [[Offenders]] to take part in a death duel against the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]] and the [[Defenders]]. Terrax was matched up against the Silver Surfer in the [[Microverse]], but neither could gain the upper hand. Because the contest was too evenly matched, [[Psycho-Man]] was introduced into the game by the one who started it all in the first place - the [[Grandmaster]]. Psycho-Man used his control box to manipulate the emotions of Terrax and the Surfer into submission. After the Red Hulk had triumphed in his contest with the Hulk, the Grandmaster inserted the red behemoth back into the game, and he destroyed Psycho-Man's armor and the entity inside. With Terrax free of Psycho-Man's control, he was ready to rid the universe of the Silver Surfer with his teammate's help. Red Hulk had other plans, however, and beheaded Terrax with his own axe. Toward the end of the game, Grandmaster revealed he had revived Terrax and placed him back in the time stream where he was found, with no memory of the event.",
