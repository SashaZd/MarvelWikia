There, Jane was briefly granted immortality and the power of the Gods.  She was unable to cope with her new powers and asked to be put back on Earth as she once was.  [[Odin]], upset at her unworthiness to be a goddess, agreed and whisked her back to [[Midgard]].  Back on Earth, with amnesia forced onto her by Odin, she met her husband Dr. Keith Kincaid and had a son with him.  Years passed and one day Jane became extremely ill on the verge of death.  [[Sif]] came to her rescue by infusing her own life force with Jane's as she lay on her deathbed.  By doing so Jane recovered her lost memories and her love for Thor was revived.",
