The authorities seemed unable to replicate the process thereafter. Clad in stars-and-strips military fatigues, he became “Captain America“, his image used to bolster Allied recruiting.\n\nOver the next three years Captain America undertook numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside Canadian “Lucky” Jim Howlett, who would later become the [[X-Men (Ultimate)|X-Men]] [[Wolverine (Ultimate)|Wolverine]]. In Poland in 1944, he battled Kleiser, one of the Nazi’s secret extraterrestrial Chitauri masters, blowing up a train delivering parts for a super weapon. A year later, he led an assault on an Icelandic base where the Nazis were launching a prototype nuclear bomb at the White House. As the rocket launched, he climbed aboard and wrecked its guidance system, causing it to explode seconds later. Though believed dead, Steve was thrown clear into the icy Arctic Ocean. Rather than dying, he seemingly fell into suspended animation and was found decades later by a team of marine biologists.\n\nSteve awoke in a S.H.I.E.L.D facility, where General and director of S.H.I.E.L.D (Nick Fury) with a handful of scientists greeted him and soon appointed leader of [[Ultimates (Ultimate)|Ultimates]], America’s new superhuman strike force. Struggling to adjust to 21st century life, he helped subdue the rampaging [[Hulk (Ultimate)|Hulk]] and attempted to recruit [[Hawk-Owl (Ultimate)|Hawk-Owl]], coming to blows with the Chicago vigilante. After teammate [[Giant-Man (Ultimate)|Giant Man]] abused and nearly killed his wife, the [[Wasp (Ultimate)|Wasp]], Steve tracked him down and hospitalized him. When the Chitauri resurfaced, Steve led a successful counterattack during which he duped the Hulk into slaying Kleiser. Soon after this mission, he and the Wasp became a couple.\n\n[[image:ultimates01.jpg|thumb|left|220px]]\nCaptain America has led the Ultimates against the [[Brotherhood Of Mutants (Ultimate)|Brotherhood of Mutants]], the X-Men, and [[Green Goblin (Ultimate)|Norman Osborn]]‘s group of failed attempts to reproduce the super-soldier process, known as the “[[Six (Ultimate)|Six]]”. On a Tunguska expedition he learned of a Soviet super-soldier project and fought a man who claimed to be his Russian counterpart. When his former teammate [[Thor (Ultimate)|Thor]] seemingly betrayed the Ultimates, Steve angrily confronted Thor, and later led the team in capturing him. Recently, Captain America was instrumental in the Ultimates forcibly stripping a Middle Eastern country of its nuclear arsenal.",
