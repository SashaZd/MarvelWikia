Journeying to [[Muir Island|Muir Island]], Amanda and the other Islanders fell under the thrall of the psionic entity [[Shadow King|the Shadow King]] until he was defeated by the X-Men.

Amanda gave the sword to Margali for safekeeping, unaware that she would use it to kill those sorcerers ahead of her on the path of mystical power called the Winding Way.\n\nFollowing her mother's capture by [[Glossary:L#limbo|Limbo]]'s then-ruler [[Belasco|Belasco]], who took possession of the Soulsword, Amanda's mind was magically switched with her mother's so that Margali could recover her strength. With Nightcrawler's help, Margali was rescued and Belasco defeated. Amanda was forced to assume control of Limbo, taking on the alias Magik in order to confuse her foes into incorrectly believing her to be Limbo's former ruler, [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Illyana Rasputin]]. As Magik, Amanda aided the X-Men in preventing an invasion of Earth by the demonic N'garai and was also instrumental in uniting the rulers of the various Hell dimensions in order to prevent their realms' destruction.",
