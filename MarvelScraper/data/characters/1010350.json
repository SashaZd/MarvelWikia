The confused pair parted awkwardly, neither fully recalling their battle, with Samantha half-convinced it was all a dream. \n\n\nBrunnhilde was later reborn in the mortal host body of Barbara Norriss and, as the Valkyrie, became a mainstay of the [[Defenders]]. She went on to become the longest-serving member of that group, remaining with them even after regaining her original Asgardian body; however, she gradually felt more detached from life on [[Earth]]. During a period when the Defenders were disbanded, Brunnhilde returned to [[Asgard]] and resumed her ancient duties as leader of the [[Valkyrior]], but Earth had not seen the last of the Valkyrie. When the rogue god [[Pluto]] sought a Valkyrie pawn, he had Amora's sister [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]] transform Samantha Parrington into the Valkyrie again. A mind-controlled Samantha served them until they ran afoul of the reunited Defenders and Brunnhilde, who routed Pluto and Lorelei after Samantha shook off their control. Happy to have a worthy successor on Earth, Brunnhilde returned to Asgard and Samantha joined the Defenders as their new Valkyrie. Her parents have tried to support her new superheroic pursuits by offering the Defenders funding, equipment and well-intentioned meddling. \n\nBrunnhilde, sadly, was among the many slain during a recent Asgardian revolt staged by Loki in fulfillment of the [[Ragnarok]] prophecies; but her proud heroic legacy lives on through Samantha Parrington.",
