Banshee unmasked the Mutant Master as a member of the alien Siri race, and the X-Men and Factor Three’s mutant agents joined forces to defeat him.\n\n\nShortly thereafter, Changeling discovered that he had terminal cancer. Seeking to make amends for his past, Changeling approached Xavier, who asked Changeling to impersonate him while he went into seclusion to prepare a means of repelling an approaching invasion by the alien Z’nox.\n\nWhile using his shape-shifting powers to pose as Xavier, Changeling heroically died while thwarting an attempt by the subterranean menace [[Grotesk]], lone survivor of a [[Glossary:S#subterranean|subterranean]] race who sought to destroy the Earth, when an oscillotron machine exploded, mortally wounding him. Changeling was impersonating Xavier at the time, and as such the X-Men believed their mentor dead until the real Professor X eventually returned.\n\nLater, the [[Glossary:V#voodoo|voodoo]] practitioner known as the [[Black Talon (Desmond Drew)|Black Talon]] resurrected Changeling as a zombie and forced him to serve in a team of other mutant zombies called the X-Humed. Using his powers to impersonate the great musician Elvis Presley, Changeling was able to draw attention to the X-Humed’s activities. After the [[Glossary:G#gamma radiation|gamma-spawned]] adventurer [[She-Hulk]] defeated the Black Talon, Changeling once again became truly dead.\n\nChangeling then seemingly returned as a malevolent ghost to haunt the British super-team [[Excalibur]], however this was later revealed to be a hoax perpetrated by the sorcerer [[Merlyn]].",
