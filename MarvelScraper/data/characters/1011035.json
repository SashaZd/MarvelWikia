Taking the form of Julia, Satana consumed Crowe's soul, increased her power via consuming more souls than she required, and began assembling an army to war on her brother, who had taken over their father's realm. Under unknown circumstances, Satana returned to Hell until being restored by [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Doctor Strange]], who joined her with [[Topaz]] and [[Kale, Jennifer|Jennifer Kale]] to end the threat of the [[Hellphyr]]. Satan revealed he had orchestrated this threat to eliminate all other magic users on Earth so he could retake his realm, but Satana turned against him again, helping to destroy the Hellphyr.
