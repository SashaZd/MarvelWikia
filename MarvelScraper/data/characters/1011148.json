        "appearance": "Adult Kree typically range from between 5 to 8 feet tall. They are bilaterally symmetric, with two legs and arms terminating with feet and hands respectively. Kree hands have four independently moving fingers each with opposable thumbs. Kree have heads with two forward facing eyes, giving them precise stereoscopic vision. Kree are typically covered in short, almost transparent, hair over most of their bodies but exhibit thicker tufts of hair on top of their heads. Kree bodies are very dense giving them increased strength, endurance, and durability. Kree have two different skin pigments in their race; blue and pink. Pink Kree are much more durable than blue Kree. Some female Kree members can psychically influence men, and a few could even drain the life force of others. There is another type of Kree called the \"Ruul\" who are able to shapeshift and can survive in any hostile environment.",
        "distinguishing_features": "Large brains, opposable thumbs, stereoscopic eyes, and either pink or blue skin pigment",
        "technology": "The Kree have mastered space travel and space colonization. The Kree also possess advanced warp-drive starships, cloaking technology, advanced energy based weaponry, advanced medical technology, genetic engineering, psionic technology, advanced robotic, cyborg, and cybernetic technology, and advanced communication technology. They also have the Omni-Wave Projector technology which can be used as a weapon and as a communication device enabling communication throughout hyperspace.",

        "specieshistory": "The Kree is an extraterrestrial humanoid race who have created a vast empire in the Greater Magellanic Cloud and have, on certain occasions, trafficked with the beings of Earth. The Kree race began on the planet Hala in the Pama system long before the first mammals appeared on Earth. The original Kree had blue-colored skin (later generations interbred with genetically-compatible aliens to produce the pink-skinned second race). Outwardly humanoid to a large degree, Kree bodies are adapted to environmental characteristics on Hala that are un-Earth-like: notably, higher gravity and higher nitrogen content in the atmosphere. Although the Kree cannot breathe Earth’s atmosphere without special apparatus, their denser bodies afford them about twice the average human being’s strength and endurance. Despite their physical superiority and relatively advanced technology, the Kree race has reached the pinnacle of their evolutionary development.",
