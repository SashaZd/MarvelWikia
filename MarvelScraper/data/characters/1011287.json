As the mansion was the home and headquarters of the [[New Mutants]] and the [[X-Men]], Warlock clashed with the teams in the confusion of his arrival, and Warlock's life energies ebbed so much that he nearly died. The New Mutants’ [[Cypher (Douglas Ramsey)|Doug Ramsey]] befriended the alien, however, and convinced Xavier and the others to allow Warlock to stay. \n\nWarlock’s personality resembled that of a young child, but he still proved to be a valuable member of the New Mutants and a worthy ally of the X-Men. He remained beside his friends throughout his time on Earth, running away briefly to join the [[Fallen Angels]] with his friend [[Sunspot]]. When appearing in public, Warlock used his powers to take on a human appearance, and he also found himself capable of merging physically and mentally with Doug Ramsey, so that they could operate as a gestalt and join the New Mutants on their adventures. Over time, Warlock's and Ramsey's consciousness rapidly began to resemble each other. The Ramsey-Warlock gestalt being could change its form so that Warlock's and Ramsey's bodies were separate but still linked at certain points. This developed a danger of permanently infecting Ramsey with the \"transmode virus\" and permanently merging the two so that they would not want to revert to normalcy.\n\nAt one point, however, Warlock was among the New Mutants captured by the X-Men's enemy [[Hodge, Cameron|Cameron Hodge]] and taken to the island of [[Genosha]], a mutant-repressive nation with advanced anti-mutant technology. Hodge had developed a cybernetic body and attempted to siphon off Warlock's shape-shifting power so he could change his robotic body at will. Hodge was confronted by the combined might of the X-Men and New Mutants, while Warlock was still imprisoned. Although Hodge's plan was thwarted by [[Wolfsbane]], tragedy had already stuck. Warlock appeared to have died, his energies leeched from him and reducing him to ashes. Later, his ashes were scattered over the grave of Doug Ramsey, who had fallen in battle months earlier.\n\nHodge's attempted assimilation of the techno-organic virus allowed him to create the composite being known as the [[Phalanx]], and the Phalanx grew as it absorbed both technological and human sources. The Phalanx also absorbed the remnants of Warlock and Ramsey, incorporating the gestalt being that Warlock and Ramsey originally developed. This separate consciousness could not exist within the Phalanx mind, presumably because the Phalanx could not absorb mutant physiology, and this consciousness soon separated itself from the Phalanx.\n\nThis being sensed the call of the android [[Zero]], who saw in the being a kindred spirit. Zero was on the run from robots that were programmed to kill him by his former master, the villain [[Stryfe]]. Zero helped the being access memories of Doug Ramsey, and the being finally shook off any remaining link to the Phalanx, referring to himself as Douglock. At the same time, the hero team [[Excalibur]] was drawn to the area, and they helped robots escape Stryfe's robotic minions. Ultimately, Zero was forced to sacrifice himself to destroy Stryfe's base, and Douglock and Excalibur escaped.\n\nDouglock joined Excalibur at its base on the mutant research facility on [[Muir Island]]. Douglock would adventure alongside his teammates while trying to assimilate into life once more. Later, he came to regard himself as a distinct being, telling his friends that he took on Ramsey's appearance as a mark of respect for his fallen friend.\n\nOnce, Douglock was captured by the secret organization [[Black Air]], who hoped to use him to harness the power of an ancient demon living beneath London. Rescued by Excalibur, Warlock resumed his quest to become more human, and eventually grew attracted to his teammate Wolfsbane.\n\nAfter many months, Excalibur disbanded, and its members scattered, although Douglock remained on Muir Island. Later still, Douglock was captured by the villain, the [[Red Skull (Johann Shmidt)|Red Skull]]. The Skull used Douglock to attack and take over the powerful Helicarrier from the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] He hoped to use the Phalanx/techno-organic technology of Douglock to control the world, but he was confronted by the X-Men, [[Deathlok (Jack Truman)|Deathlok]], and [[Machine Man]]. Ultimately, Douglock was freed from the Red Skull's thrall. Returning to his previous name of Warlock, he dedicated himself to rid the world of all techno-organic technology.\n\nOne result of his quest was the discovery of the government's [[Project Mainspring]], who turned out to be a young girl named [[Hope]]. Warlock freed Hope, finding out that she was a carrier of the techno-organic virus without being infected herself. Warlock continued his travels, taking Hope with him, determined to find a cure for her and to put an end to techno-organic technology. \n\nRecently, Warlock rejoined the New Mutants.",
