When she got there, a fight between the [[Sisterhood of the Wasps]] and the [[Spider Society]] left her fatally injured. Miguel, the Spider Society's sorcerer, was forced to transfer some of his power to her to save her life, and after the transfer she received a spider-shaped tattoo which gave her enhanced strength and agility. It also presumably gave her an exoskeleton. Araña and Miguel shared several adventures together as the Mage-Hunter team for the Spider Society, preventing the Wasps from summoning their chosen warrior.\n\nRecently, Araña learned that she is not a true Hunter. No Hunter before her has ever had an exoskeleton like hers. In a battle in which the Sisterhood again attempted to summon their Hunter, Miguel was killed (despite [[Spider-Man|Spider-Man's]] assistance). Araña released and transferred the power of the Hunter to Spider Society member Nina Smith, yet Anya retained many of her superhuman abilities.\n\nEven though she has quit [[WebCorps]], she insisted on fighting for the greater good.  She is currently in training as a [[Civil War|registered]] super-hero under the tutelage of [[Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers)|Ms. Marvel]].",
