Going back into action as the White Tiger, Hector was framed for murder and convicted despite the efforts of his lawyer, Matt Murdock. Ayala was shot dead trying to escape, shortly before evidence emerged that belatedly proved his innocence.\n\nMurdock himself had recently been \"outed\" as the masked crimefighter Daredevil, though he publicly denied his double identity. Trying to understand super-heroes in general and her late uncle in particular, Angela - now a Federal Agent - volunteered to participate in the ongoing FBI investigation of Murdock; however, when Hector's amulets were handed down to her, an overwhelmed Angela asked Murdock to help her decide what to do with them. Knowing the terrible cost of the vigilante lifestyle - and having seen her own partner, Agent Harold Driver, killed during the Daredevil investigation - Angela wanted to know why anyone would ever play super-hero. She told Murdock she was willing to quit the FBI and abandon her case if he could answer her questions. Recognizing Angela's sincerity, Murdock challenged her to scale St. Catherine's Cathedral, then engaged her in rooftop combat as Daredevil. Convinced of her ability, Murdock presented Angela with a final lesson by leading her to a robbery in progress. Subduing the robbers single-handedly, a proud Angela was touched by the awestruck gratitude of the shopkeeper she had rescued, and she finally began to understand her new calling. Shortly thereafter, Del Toro rescued Murdock from ex-crimelord [[Bont, Alexander|Alexander Bont]] and his reluctant henchman [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], beating Potter into submission and making her mark as the new White Tiger. \n\nNote: The White Tigers of the Ayala and Del Toro clans are unrelated to the [[High Evolutionary]]'s [[White Tiger (New Men)|White Tiger]] (an artificially evolved tiger-woman who voluntarily resumed her original animal form after a stint with [[Heroes for Hire]]) and urban vigilante [[Cole, Kasper|Kevin \"Kasper\" Cole]], alias White Tiger, an acolyte of the [[Panther Cult]] and a protégé of the [[Black Panther (T'Challa)|Black Panther]].",
