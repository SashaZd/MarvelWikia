His skin can withstand brief exposure to flame, ice, and acid without damage. His bones and muscles have been augmented to such a degree that he can withstand the impact of being hit by a truck carrying ten tons of cargo traveling at 60 miles per hour without serious injury. The Armadillo possesses superhuman endurance as well, enabling him to exert himself at peek capacity for over an hour before fatigue begins to impair his performance.

In desperation, he sought Dr. Karl Malus, a criminal scientist who specializes in the generation and bestowal of superhuman powers, whom he had heard about while in prison. Malus agreed to try to cure her in exchange for the man agreeing to become his test subject and employee for an indefinite period of time.",

Malus agreed to try to cure her in exchange for the man agreeing to become his test subject and employee for an indefinite period of time. \n\n\nMalus had long been interested in acquiring a superhuman henchman, particularly after his experiments on the Fly, the Hornet, the [[Werewolf By Night|Werewolf]], and [[Atlas (Erik Josten)|Goliath]] failed to provide him one. Malus subjected the man to an experimental process that combined [[Glossary:G#genetic|genetic]] material from an armadillo with the man's genes. The Process caused the man's strength to increase drastically, his skin to transform into a tough, organic armored plate, and his hands to grow thick tough claws. Malus dubbed him the Armadillo and assigned him to break into the [[Avengers West Coast|West Coast Avengers]] Compound to steal the comatose body of Goliath who was being held there. The Armadillo complied and soon found himself in combat with visiting [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]]. Although physically superior to him, the Armadillo was defeated by the Captain's superior combat skills. Taking compassion on the Armadillo's plight because of his wife's condition, Captain America refused to turn the Armadillo over to the authorities. After Malus cured Maria, Armadillo joined the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]].\n\nArmadillo escaped from the raft after [[Electro (Maxwell Dillon)|Electro's]] break out. Recaptured by the [[New Warriors]] he was later placed in the fifty states [[Initiative]] as part of the Texas Rangers. Later attending [[Stilt-Man|Stilt-Manâ€™s]] wake, it is unlikely that Antonio was hurt by the attack carried out by the [[Punisher (Frank Castle) | Punisher]] due to his thick hide and altered genetics.",
