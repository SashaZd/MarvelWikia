As all of the other [[Great Lakes Avengers]], Dinah Soar had not been taken seriously by the rest of the superhuman community that were aware of her existence, but her aerial acrobatics were nothing to scoff at.  She had fought side by side with her teammates against such foes as [[Deadpool]], the [[Thunderbolts]], and [[Graviton]], but it was only during the battle against [[Maelstrom]] that her concern for her injured lover led her to be distracted long enough for Maelstrom to deliver a killing blow. Despite the protests of Mr. Immortal, there was little he could do to save the life of this super heroine whose life was cut way too short.",
