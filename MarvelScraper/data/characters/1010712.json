He can use this mass to elongate, compress, or enlarge various parts of his body. He can also form non-humanoid shapes with his body such as hammer-shaped fists or a trampoline-shaped torso. His bones can stretch to a maximum of five times their ordinary length. His body tissue can resist extreme temperatures, burning, lacerations, ballistic penetration, and impacts without sustaining injury. The Shape also has a high threshold for physical pain. However, the Shape's low intelligence prevents him from thinking of more creative uses for his shifting body mass. He is not invulnerable: certain extreme physical injuries are beyond his ability to tolerate and survive.",

Shape sided with the Squadron when the Redeemers openly opposed them, and he remained with them as they began to dismantle the Utopia Program. \n\nShape also left with the team to confront the powerful Nth Man, whose existence threatend the Squadron's Earth. Although the Nth Man was thwarted, Shape and the Squadron became trapped on the mainstream Earth for many months. When he finally returned to his native dimension, Shape was injured in reentry and was remanded to hospital care.",
