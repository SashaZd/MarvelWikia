(Although born decades earlier, their prolonged aging allows them to be only in their young teens currently.) The twins were raised by their guardians, [[Wallop|Walter]] and Florence, whom they were told to believe were their Uncle and Grandmother. Not knowing their true origin, the twins believed themselves mutants, as their powers, heightened by each other's proximity, developed early. Pandora was convinced to follow Rory as super-hero champions, although Pandora was definitely less interested in such escapades.",

Not knowing their true origin, the twins believed themselves mutants, as their powers, heightened by each other's proximity, developed early. Pandora was convinced to follow Rory as super-hero champions, although Pandora was definitely less interested in such escapades.\n\nOne such excursion brought the twins upon a battle between the scientific organization [[A.I.M.]] and lackeys of the mutated being [[Lenz]]. The twins tried to stop them by taking the object of their dispute, the Gryphon, but soon fled the scene. Pandora's cape was stolen during the battle, and this caused the existence of the Clan to be revealed, and Lenz sent his agents to systematically kill the Destine family members. Pandora and Rory were soon told of their legacy, and the family eventually stopped the villain.\n\nWalter tried to force the children to stop using their powers as crime fighters, prompting Rory to run away with Pandora's help (since they needed to be together to have their powers activated.) Pandora helped stop an assassination attempt on her Clan sister, [[Cuckoo (Kay Cera)|Cuckoo]], and Walter reluctantly agreed to allow the children to fight crime with a chaperone.\n\nPandora was on hand when the demon [[Synraith]] pitted the mutant heroes of the [[X-Men]] against the ClanDestine in order to free himself. Pandora, not taken in by the illusions of Synraith (who tempted Rory and Pandora to join the X-Men,) was one of the first to realize the deception. Synraith was ultimately destroyed and the two teams soon parted under amiable terms.",
