Due to a throwback gene sequence, Deathbird was born with wings, which enabled her to fly. During her years as a respected member of the Royal Family she taught martial arts to [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], and became the Empire's best hand-to-hand combatant. For unrevealed crimes she was stripped of her name and banished from Chandilar, giving her the name of Deathbird. Her brother, D'Ken, was next in line for the throne, and he became Emperor of the Shi'ar Empire. \n\nDeathbird arrived on Earth on mysterious circumstances and while attempting to retrieve her spaceship she fought [[Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers)|Ms. Marvel]], and later [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]. When she was finally able to leave the planet, she allied herself with the [[Brood]] in order to recuperate her throne, now in the power of [[Lilandra]], her younger sister. Stranding Lilandra on Earth by implanting a Brood parasite on [[Professor X]], she returned to [[Chandilar]] and usurped the throne. \n\nLilandra allied herself with the [[Starjammers]] and created a resistance against Deathbird's rule. They battle for many months, but eventually, Deathbird was forced to escape.  Deathbird rescued [[Lila Cheney]] and made her teleport the [[X-Men]] to her, asking them to slay Professor Charles Xavier. The X-Men were rescued by Lilandra and the Starjammers, and soon joined them into fighting the Shi'ar [[Imperial Guard]], who still followed Deathbird as ruler. Soon after, the newest members of the X-Men [[Gambit]] and [[Jubilee]] witnessed as Xavier took over the minds of [[Oracle]] and Gladiator, and forced Gladiator to remove her natural wings. Gambit and Jubilee reacted, saving Deathbrid's life, however they were overpowered by Xavier and Gladiator. Deathbird, escaped thanks to Lila Cheney. Soon after Wolverine slaughtered Xavier, and Lilandra, newly crowned as Majestrix of the Shi'ar Empire,  proclaimed the X-Men were traitors and had be put in jail. Seconds later, Lila Cheney and Deathbird returned, and teleported [[Storm]],[[Banshee]] and [[Forge]] away. The X-Men allied themselves with Deathbird and together exposed the [[Warskrulls]], saving the real Professor X and the rest of the X-Men. Deathbird then officially abdicated the throne, claiming the life of ruler was boring.\n\nWhen the Kree and the Skrull went to war, Deathbird slaughtered the Kree rulers. After the Shi'ar won the war and conquered the Kree Empire, Deathbird was named Viceroy of the Kree territories, which she ruled with an iron thumb. \n\nUnder unknown circumstances, Deathbird was found by the X-Men as the sole survivor of a Shi'ar Space Station. She immediately found herself attracted to the X-Man [[Bishop (Lucas Bishop)|Bishop]]. Together with the X-Men they stopped the threat of the Phalanx, restoring peace to the Shi'ar Homeworld, Chandilar. Deathbird was chosen by the Majestrix herself to escort the X-Men back to Earth. However the X-Men's ship exploded in mid-travel, and Deathbird and Bishop were stranded in space. They crashed into an alien planet and fought their way out of it. Months later, they crossed a faulty stargate, which took them into an alternate future reality, where Earth was ruled by the Shi'ar. [[Alanna Neramani]], daughter of Xavier and Lilandra, offered Deathbird to rule Earth, while Bishop joined the Resistance. Eventually, Deathbird chose to follow Bishop and helped the Resistance defeat Alanna. The pair later returned to the 616 reality.\n\nAs they approached Earth, they found a gigantic humanoid shape, which had a mutant signature. Confused, they approached it, but after finding nothing on it, Deathbird betrayed Bishop, firing on him and delivering him to the hands of a mysterious cult. Weeks later, Deathbird appeared as War, a Horseman of [[Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur)|Apocalypse]], with a pair of artificial wings to replace those she had lost. She helped [[Caliban]], the Horseman known as Pestilence, against X-Force and Cable, and ensured the latter's capture. Deathbird then fought Iceman and captured him. Soon after, as Apocalypse's plans backfired, Deathbird and the rest of the Horsemen fought against the X-Men. Amidst the battle, Bishop was sent to Earth-9910 and Mikhail Rasputin teleported the Horsemen away.\n\nMonths later, Earth was turned into a prison planet by the Galactic Council of [[Selandiar]]. Deathbird had found her way to another Shi'ar Space Station, and she murdered all the Shi'ar stationed there. As [[Cadre K]] searched the station, Bishop returned to the 616 reality once more, only to find Deathbird, who used him as a human shield against Cadre K. Bishop teamed up with the Professor X-led team of mutant skrulls to defeat Deathbird, who in the end gave him a key to enter [[Ronan]]'s Watchtower in Earth orbit, and then opened a hatch and flew towards open space.",
