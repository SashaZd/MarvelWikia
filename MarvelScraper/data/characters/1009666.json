        "bio": "An exceptionally strong and vigorous athlete in his youth, John Proudstarâ€™s [[Glossary:M#mutant|mutant]] abilities first manifested when he wrestled a charging bison to save a young girl. Proudstar became dissatisfied with the seemingly complacent lives led by his tribespeople on the Apache Indian reservation in Camp Verde, Arizona, and he sought to prove he was a warrior in the tradition of his ancestors.\n\n\nEventually, Proudstar lied about his age to join the United States Marines. Attaining the rank of corporal, he earned a number of medals, including one for rescuing the pilot of a helicopter downed by a thunderstorm during which he witnessed what he believed to be a great bird of lightning in the sky.\n\nAfter his tour of duty was completed, Proudstar returned to the reservation and was soon approached by ex-newspaper reporter [[Whitecloud, Michael|Michael Whitecloud]] for help in investigating a series of mysterious cancer diagnoses, including Proudstarâ€™s mother. The pair uncovered illegal experiments performed by Doctor [[Martynec, Edwin|Edwin Martynec]], himself a mutant who could transform into a hybrid coyote creature. Proudstar battled Martynec before he escaped after setting off an explosion that destroyed his laboratory.\n\nLater, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], founder of the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the [[X-Men]], recruited Proudstar as a member of the second generation of X-Men, giving him the codename Thunderbird. Soon after, the new X-Men opposed [[Count Nefaria]], who had taken over the North American Air Defense (NORAD) command center in Cheyenne Mountain in an international extortion scheme. Defeated by the X-Men, Nefaria attempted to escape in a small aircraft, but Thunderbird jumped onto the plane as it took off. Defying Xavierâ€™s [[Glossary:T#telepathic|telepathic]] warnings to get off the plane, Thunderbird sought to prove he was a true Apache warrior and, using his superhuman strength, pummeled the aircraft until it exploded, killing him instantly.\n\nLater, just prior to Thunderbirdâ€™s funeral, his younger brother [[Warpath|James]] stole his body and gave him a traditional Apache warriorâ€™s funeral rite. \n\nRecently, John was revived by [[Eli Bard]] to [[Selene]]. After fighting with his brother, he died again, and his spirit was freed after the death of Selene.",
