Before she burned out her original sonic powers, Melissa's cybernetically enhanced vocal cords could produce super-sonic screams causing effects such as disorientation, hallucinations or unconsciousness. She can still produce inaudible ultrasonic waves with which she can subtly influence the emotions and conduct of people around her. Her other current vocal powers only function in concert with her high-tech harness.",

        "bio": "When Melissa Gold was a child, her mother was sent to prison for robbery. Overwhelmed by taunts from other children and abuse from her drunken father, Melissa ran away from home to find her mother. She grew up on the streets, adopting her mother's name \"Mimi\" as part of a hard, cold persona she developed as a survival mechanism. \n\nShe also dated a criminal named Mike, who abandoned her to the police when he was found with stolen goods. In prison, Melissa met wrestler Marian Pouncy who brought her into the costumed wrestling team the [[Grapplers]] as \"Screaming Mimi\". The Grapplers moonlighted as criminals and were cybernetically enhanced by [[Roxxon Oil]], who had hired them to invade the government's [[Project: PEGASUS]] facility, but they were defeated by [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] and [[Goliath (Bill Foster)|Giant-Man]].\n\nScreaming Mimi eventually left the Grapplers, serving in [[Baron Zemo (Helmut Zemo)|Helmut Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil]] and partnering with the similarly powered [[Angar the Screamer]]; however, Angar was killed during a robbery and a grieving Mimi went on a screaming rampage that destroyed her voice. She was rescued by Zemo, who recruited her back into his Masters and had the [[Fixer (Paul Norbert Ebersol)|Fixer]] grant her new abilities based on [[Klaw]]'s Sonic Horn. When Zemo's new Masters disguised themselves as the heroic [[Thunderbolts]], Melissa adopted the identity of Songbird and became romantically involved with teammate [[MACH-IV|Abe Jenkins]], alias M.A.C.H. 1, who trained her in aerial combat. \n\nUltimately, she and Abe were among the Thunderbolts who turned against Zemo and tried to prove to the world that they had reformed. As part of his reformation, Abe has voluntarily served additional time in prison while Songbird continued to serve with the Thunderbolts. After the team disbanded following an altercation with the [[Avengers]], Melissa joined a new incarnation of the Thunderbolts assembled by Abe, but the time she and Abe have spent apart has strained their relationship.",
