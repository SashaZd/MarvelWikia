The first time they sparred, Angel panicked, unprepared for combat.  Though he felt ill suited for battle, he soon went through a baptism of fire, overcoming his fears to help his team mates fight a [[Sentinel (Ultimate)|Sentinel]] robot. When serial killer [[Sinister (Ultimate)|Sinister]] invaded Xavier's school, Angel proved his mettle, confronting him solo and successfully disarming him before Sinister regained the upper hand with his hypnotic power. Rogue finally subdued the villain, and Sinister's assault failed. \n\nAngel soon formed strong friendships with his fellow [[X-Men (Ultimate)|X-Men]], covertly playing Captain Eagle to [[Nightcrawler (Ultimate)|Nightcrawler's]] Dread Pirate Bluetail in secret Danger Room adventures, and taking charge in group training sessions. When some of the team was sent to [[Genosha (Ultimate)|Genosha]] to investigate the veracity of murder charges against the mutant [[Longshot (Ultimate)|Longshot]], Angel reluctantly joined [[Dazzler (Ultimate)|Dazzler's]] unauthorized trip to [[Krakoa (Ultimate)|Krakoa]] to rescue the convict. Electing to remain alone by the jet, he was captured and badly injured, forcing his friends to come to his rescue. Upon returning home, the group was berated by Xavier, who threatened to expel the ringleader. The still-recovering Angel took the blame, earning Dazzler's thanks, and they soon began dating. When the couple tried to prevent a breakout from [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Ultimate)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Triskelion]], Dazzler was severely injured by [[Deathstrike (Ultimate)|Deathstrike]], and left comatose. Angel, at Professor X's behest, has infiltrated the [[Academy of Tomorrow (Ultimate)|Academy of Tomorrow]], on the understanding he can rejoin the X-Men should Dazzler awaken.",
