Few can resist her beauty, particularly when she augments it with her magic; a single kiss is often enough to make a man her slave. She is one of the most powerful mystics in Asgard or on Earth, capable of energy blasts, protective shields, illusions, levitation, teleportation, conjuring, interdimensional travel, transmutation, time-disruption and mind control. As her sorcerous powers stem largely from Asgardian sources, her magic is strongest within the realm of Asgard and gradually diminishes the longer she remains outside of Asgard, though her powers never fade completely.",

In time, Amora became one of the more powerful magic-wielders in Asgard, with her magical arsenal focused on (but not limited to) charming and mind-controlling people. Her by now well renowned beauty did not hinder in this.\n\nAmora has devoted her immortal life to the pursuit of power and pleasure, using sorcery and sexuality as her tools. Born into the [[Asgardians|Asgardian gods]], Amora studied under the mighty sorceress [[Karnilla The Norn Queen]], who ultimately expelled her for being too undisciplined. Amora went on to study under many other Asgardian mages, often seducing them to learn their secrets. By the time she reached adulthood, Amora was a powerful sorceress, famous for her beauty and infamous for her heartless scheming. An early alliance with the warrior goddess [[Valkyrie (Brunnhilde)|Brunnhilde the Valkyrie]] ended with Amora trapping Brunnhilde's soul, using the Valkyrie's vacated form as a shell for herself and various pawns to inhabit over the centuries that followed. Brunnhilde would eventually return, becoming one of Amora's bitterest enemies. \n\nAmora's longest-serving pawn was [[Executioner (Skurge)|Skurge the Executioner]]. Skurge was madly in love with Amora, who granted him just enough affection to ensure his loyalty. The two pursued many schemes together, often coming into conflict with the thunder god [[Thor (Thor Odinson)|Thor]] and his mortal comrades, the [[Avengers]]. When Skurge eventually sacrificed his life aiding Thor in an heroic rescue mission, Amora mourned him with a genuine grief that surprised everyone, including the Enchantress herself. [[image: amora02.jpg|thumb|left|185px]]Other smitten pawns such as the original [[Atlas (Erik Josten)|Power Man]] (Erik Josten) and a new, human [[Executioner (Benhurst)|Executioner]] (Brute Benhurst) never served the Enchantress quite so well as Skurge, and were soon abandoned. \n\nPardoned in recent years after helping defend [[Asgard]] against [[Surtur]], Amora has had an on-and-off romantic link with her longtime foe Thor, to whom she was drawn even more strongly after he inherited the throne of Asgard. As Thor's ally, advisor and sometime lover, Amora has been a prominent figure in Thor's Asgard. Sadly, Amora was among the many Asgardians apparently slain when Thor's brother [[Loki]] led a revolt in fulfillment of the Ragnarok prophecies. Whether she will rise again remains to be seen.",
