        "bio": "Jerome Beechman was born a mutant in the small town of Los Alamos in New Mexico. Rejected by everyone around him due to his hairy and freakish appearance his father abandoned him in a desert when he was ten years old. He swore revenge on those who mocked him and began to wander the desert. While wandering the desert he ran into [[Nekra]], a runaway albino mutant who was also lived in Los Alamos. The two of them grew close over the years as they wandered from place to place. One day while in New Mexico a group of teenagers attacked the duo because of their freakish appearances. The duo became cornered and their mutant powers manifested, killing several of the teenagers. \n\nYears later taking the name Mandrill he launched a political scheme in order to take over several small African nations alongside Nekra. However [[Shanna The She-Devil]] became involved and defeated the two mutants and they were taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. Somehow the two mutants escaped S.H.I.E.L.D. and founded the organization called [[Black Spectre]]. The group was then opposed by Shanna, [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]], [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], and the [[Thing (Benjamin Grimm)|Thing]]. During the fight Nekra was captured, but Mandrill managed to escape. \n\nAfter his last plot failed he approached his world conquest scheme from a different angle and hypnotized a group of women and forced them to do his bidding as [[Fem-Force]]. He also recruited the mutant super villain team called [[Mutant Force]] in order to help him in his plot. The [[Defenders]] eventually learned of the plot and managed to capture Mutant Force. Mandrill then retreated after being beaten by the Defenders several times. Mandrill then proceeded to become an arms dealer by selling Wakandan technology, but was stopped by [[Black Panther (T'Challa)|Black Panther]]. Mandrill then decided to have his revenge against his family and attacked the nuclear power plant where his parents worked. Once again, the Defenders defeated him, and he was shot by his mother Margaret, who was immune to his pheremones.\n\nMandrill eventually recovered and learned that [[Grim Reaper]] killed Nekra. Enraged and crazed he attacked the Grim Reaper, who during the battle managed to seemingly kill him. Yet sometime later Mandrill showed up at an auction that was stopped by [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] and [[Alpha Flight]]. Mandrill was then incarcerated in the [[Vault]], where he was a member of [[Crossfire]]'s mind control [[Crossfire's Mind Control Gang|gang]]; though he managed to escape, he was stopped a few yards from the prison by the [[Thunderbolts]]. He was later moved to the minaturized prison known as the \"[[Big House]]\" where he played a key role in the mass break out that was foiled by the [[She-Hulk]]. He was then transferred to the [[Raft]] and managed to escape when [[Electro (Maxwell Dillon)|Electro]] started a mass breakout. Rejoining the other members of Crossfire's gang, he participated in Crossfire's running battle against the [[U-Foes]] before he and the others were captured by the [[Avengers]].\n\nHis current whereabouts are unknown. It is unsure if he was one of the many mutants who were depowered during the [[House of M]] event.",
