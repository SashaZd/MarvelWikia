She began a relationship with [[Cannonball]] that would last until he graduated and joined the [[X-Men]]. \n\nFollowing her father's near-death experience with Sebastian Shaw and Holocaust, Tabitha underwent a drastic change in looks and personality. She renamed herself Meltdown and became something of a loose cannon. When ex-spy Pete Wisdom assumed leadership of X-Force, he introduced them to the shadowy world of covert operations. After a mission, the team was considered deceased (including Tabitha). \n\nWhen Cable reformed X-Force, Tabitha briefly rejoined the team. Later, she resurfaced as a member of [[Nextwave]]. She later appeared as a captive of a resurrected [[Leper Queen]] as a part of sentinel-from-the-future Bastion's plan to wreak havoc on the remaining mutant populace. However, she was rescued by members of the new [[X-Force]] and taken to San Francisco to be with the X-Men.",
