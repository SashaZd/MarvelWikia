Upon finally meeting him, she single-handedly defeated Iron Man's nemesis, the despotic [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]], overwhelming him with the squirrels under her control. Nevertheless, Iron Man declined her offer of partnership.\n\nSquirrel Girl subsequently moved to New York City to fight crime, earning quite the reputation as Central Park’s greatest protector. There, Green was recruited into the would-be super-team the [[Great Lakes Avengers]], helping them defeat [[Maelstrom]] and his agents, [[Batroc's Brigade]], although during this time she had to deal with losing her most trusted squirrel companion, [[Monkey Joe]], who was killed by the GLA’s rejected teammate, Leather Boy. In the wake of the disastrous battle against Maelstrom, Squirrel Girl adopted a new sidekick, calling her Tippy-Toe. After discovering that Squirrel Girl was a mutant, the other members found they shared this commonality, after which they changed their name to the Great Lakes X-Men (to avoid a lawsuit from the Avengers’ Maria Stark Foundation.) \n\nWith a mixture of success, pluck, and a cheery smile, Squirrel Girl has quickly become a favored ally of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], but she declined the opportunity to be a deputized agent, preferring her own team.  Months before, however, she long wanted to join the [[New Warriors]] when they first appeared, in particular due to her obsessive crush with [[Speedball (Robert Baldwin)|Speedball]]. So when Speedball was on tour promoting the New Warriors’ reality-TV show, Squirrel Girl rushed to the appearance, hoping he could catch a glimpse of her. He didn’t, not even when she stopped his enemy, the [[Bug-Eyed Voice]], from exacting revenge. (Speedball did eventually learn of Squirrel Girl’s help, and he personally thanked her, with a kiss!)\n\nLater called the Great Lakes Champions after winning the title in a poker tournament hosted by the [[Thing (Benjamin Grimm)|Thing]], the team recently encountered [[Deadpool]] after becoming officially-sanctioned heroes due to the [[Civil War|Superhuman Registration Act]].",
