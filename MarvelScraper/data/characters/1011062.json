He can employ his cosmic energies for a vast number of effects. He can project large amounts of cosmic energy with great concussive force. He can mentally manipulate the molecules of ordinary matter into other shapes with different properties. He can alter his own size, mass, and density to unknown limits at will (he has appeared at 6 feet in stature as well as 50 feet), or alter the size and mass of other objects and organisms. He can convert matter to an unknown form of energy and teleport it through space at hyper-light speeds. He can erect invisible force shields of great impermeability. Further, he can use cosmic energy to enhance his own physical powers, such as speed, strength, and endurance. He can mentally manipulate [[Glossary:G#graviton|gravitons]] to allow himself to levitate. The extent of the Stranger’s extrasensory and psionic powers are unknown.",

Gigantus, the home of a highly advanced and pacifistic people, was the target of the imperialistic race of [[Eternians]], who decided to destroy Gigantus when it proved too big to conquer. Before their world’s destruction, however, a vast fleet of Gigantian escaped to retaliate against their attackers. After destroying Eternus, the Gigantians in some as yet unknown way melded their minds into a single being, apparently to one day combat Eternians’ similar composite entity, the [[Overmind]]. It is not yet known what the process of this merger entailed: whether the composite-form’s body is an artificial organic construct or one of the Gigantians’ bodies enhanced to be a suitable receptacle for his race’s mental and physical might. This being, later to become known as the Stranger, has existed for some eons now, engaged in the same pursuit of knowledge that had engaged his race.",

This being, later to become known as the Stranger, has existed for some eons now, engaged in the same pursuit of knowledge that had engaged his race.\n\nThe Stranger happened upon Earth in the mid-20th Century, apparently attracted by the sudden proliferation of superhumanly powered beings on Earth. Investigating some of these beings the Stranger encountered [[Magneto (Magnus)|Magneto]] and his [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], and the original [[X-Men]]. The Stranger took Magneto and the [[Toad]] with him to his home-base to study. Apparently from his observations of Magneto and the Toad, the Stranger concluded that the powers in the process of development by the denizens of Earth would be misused and, in time, become a threat to other worlds. Thus he journeyed to Earth in two occasions for the express purpose of limiting Earth’s population through a random purge. On each of these occasions, he was convinced by the selfless actions of Earth beings (the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]] and scientist Al Harper) the Earth had the potential for good. After his second attempt to destroy Earth, the Stranger declared it safe from any future reprisals.\n\nSince that time, the Stranger has employed his vast powers on behalf of the Earth. The first of these incidents pitted him against his ancient enemy, the Overmind. The Stranger used his superior power to imprison the Overmind on a mole of dust. The second time he assisted Earth in the deactivation of the [[Null-Life Bomb]], the same device that he once invented to destroy Earth’s population. The third time he came to Earth was to thwart a plot by the Olympian god [[Pluto]].\n\nThe Stranger remains an enigmatic being, studying the phenomena of the universe for unknown reasons, and acting toward other living beings with unfathomable motives.",
