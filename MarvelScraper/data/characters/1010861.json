Placed in solitary confinement for nearly a year after another unsuccessful clash with Captain America, the already unstable Scarecrow snapped. Upon escaping, he went on a killing spree until Captain America captured him. Imprisoned in the [[Vault]], where [[Ronin (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and Iron Man recaptured him during a mass breakout, Scarecrow eventually escaped and committed further serial slayings, seeking to \"free the fear\" within his victims, but he was defeated by [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)]]. Left for dead, Scarecrow was rescued by the shadowy organization the [[Firm]], who instilled in him the ability to feed off fear, after which he again battled Captain America. \n\nDying in another battle with Ghost Rider, Scarecrow was resurrected by the [[Demons|demon]] [[Blackheart]], who sent Ebenezer's bodiless spirit to possess the dead body of Barbara Ketch, sister of Ghost Rider's human host. Following a harrowing battle, Scarecrow's soul was once again cast into Hell. Somehow returning to physical life, Scarecrow battled the Falcon before being sent to the [[Raft]] super-prison, where he escaped during a recent massive breakout. He was hired by the [[Chameleon]] to serve within his team, the [[Exterminators]], seeking vengeance against Spider-Man after his secret identity was made public.",
