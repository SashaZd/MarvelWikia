While in her compressed form, she must take careful breaths as her lung capacity is diminished. She can stretch her body, is immune to most forms of injury, becomes razor sharp along the edge of her form, and she can compress the bodies of others by wrapping herself around them. Victims rendered entirely two-dimensional from this die from diminished lung capacity; victims who are partially affected will recover over a period of hours.",
