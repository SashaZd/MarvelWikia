The Watchers would then sporadically reassemble to pool their knowledge and share what they had witnessed. \n\nIkor's son, Uatu, chose Earth's solar system as his new home and was based in the [[Glossary:B#Blue_Area_of_The_Moon|\"Blue Area\" of Earth's moon]], an abandoned settlement built by the alien [[Kree]] and [[Cotati]], from which he observed Earth for billions of years. At first, Uatu adhered to his race's vow of non-interference: he did not physically intervene when the Gunan known as Xakku the Sun-Stealer threatened to transport Earth's sun to his own solar system (although he did trick the alien into expending his oxygen tanks before he could accomplish his mission) and even spurned the affections of the extraterrestrial Queen Kalthea, who offered Uatu her hand in marriage after his appearance caused the barbarians threatening her kingdom to retreat; but over the centuries, Uatu grew so fond of the lifeforms he observed that he occasionally violated his vow of non-interference when Earth's existence was threatened. Uatu's first recorded encounter with an Earthling occurred in the year 1602 A.D. when a possible-future [[Captain America (Earth-311)|Captain America]] was inadvertently sent back in time to that era, causing ripples in the [[Glossary:T#timestream|timestream]] that threatened the very fabric of reality. Uatu revealed the nature of the problem to an Elizabethan-era version of [[Strange, Stephen (Earth-311)|Dr. Stephen Strange]], who helped send the temporally-displaced Captain America back through a [[Glossary:T#time|time]]-portal, correcting the timeline. Uatu's superior, however, allowed the divergent timeline [[Marvel 1602 (Earth-311)|(Earth-311)]] to persist in a pocket dimension. Decades ago, Uatu assisted the [[Destroyer (Roger Aubrey)]], [[Iron Cross (Helmut Gruler)]], [[Richards, Nathaniel|Nathaniel Richards]], and [[Stark, Howard|Howard Stark]] on a mission to save mankind.\n\nIn modern times, Uatu met the [[Fantastic Four]] when they visited the Moon to investigate the Blue Area. The criminal mastermind [[Red Ghost]] and his Super-Apes had also landed there and soon attacked the [[Thing (Benjamin Grimm)|Thing]]. Uatu revealed his presence to the Earthlings and ended the fight, decreeing that the Fantastic Four would battle Red Ghost and his simian cohorts. Uatu was impressed with the FF's victory and gave them his blessings, allowing them to retain their memories of his existence. Uatu became fond of the Fantastic Four and began to warn them of impending dangers, such as the [[Molecule Man]], who gained matter-manipulation powers in a lab accident. After the Molecule Man's defeat, Uatu transported the [[Glossary:S#super-villain|villain]] to an other-[[Glossary:D#dimension|dimensional]] world where time passed at an accelerated rate and reinforced the self-imposed mental blocks which limited Molecule Man's ability to use his powers. \n\nSoon after, at the wedding of [[Mister Fantastic|Mr. Fantastic]] and [[Invisible Woman]], Uatu helped Mr. Fantastic defeat the horde of super-villains who threatened the ceremony by transporting him to the Watcher's home and not dis-allowing him to pick a weapon to send the villains back to before they were controlled, and erase their memories. Afterwards, Uatu allowed Reed and Sue to honeymoon in the Blue Area's city, providing an opulent banquet hall and assuring the newlyweds that they would be the only beings in the galaxy that he would not be watching that night. Later, when [[Galactus]] first menaced Earth, Uatu tried to hide the planet from the world-devourer, debated him as to why the Earth should be spared, and finally helped the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] obtain the only weapon capable of destroying the [[Glossary:C#cosmic|cosmic]] menace -- the [[Ultimate Nullifier]]. Uatu also studied alternate realities, which he observed through a portal given to him by the Time-Keepers, a group of beings who existed at the end of time itself. \n\nEventually, Uatu disgraced himself completely by physically opposing the Kree soldier [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Mar-Vell]] after allying himself with the [[Lunatic Legion]], a Kree faction opposed to Mar-Vell who were led by [[Zarek]], [[Fer-Porr]], and [[Sro-Himm]] and based in the Moon's Blue Area. Placed on trial by his own people for his numerous violations of their ethics code, Uatu explained that he had come to identify with the action and emotion that he observed on Earth, and thus yearned to become involved. At the conclusion of his trial, Uatu was released from custody on his own recognizance after promising never to interfere in the affairs of other races again. \n\n[[image:thewatcher01.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]Later, Uatu was captured by intergalactic gambler A'Sai via a weapon from one of Galactus' former worldships. Uatu allowed himself to be coerced into a football wager-- Uatu's technology vs. A'Sai's weapon--but when [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] led Uatu's team to victory, Uatu destroyed the weapon and transformed A'Sai into a casino playing card as punishment for his intent to renege. Uatu also saved the life of Bette Chekhov, granddaughter of Anton, one of [[Parker, May (Aunt May)|May Parker's]] former boarders. When the criminal [[Living Laser]] tried to escape [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] by flying into Uatu's alternate worlds portal and diverged into separate beings in seven different alternate realities, Uatu enlisted Quasar to recapture the Living Laser. Based on the Watcher Otmu's theory that even observation affected others, the \"Oblivion Plague\" caused many Watchers to end their existences; though perpetuated by [[Maelstrom]], the Plague was ended when Quasar convinced the Watchers that they must continue to observe so they could pass on their accumulated recordings to the next universe.\n\nPresent at Uatu's earlier trial was his nephew Aron, a relatively young Watcher mentored by his uncle who was not yet assigned a solar system to observe. Fascinated by Earth, Aron eventually broke the Watcher's code by manipulating the Fantastic Four and [[Inhumans]] into a fight. Now a \"rogue\" Watcher, Aron grew more malevolent; after cloning the Fantastic Four and trying to create a pocket world within the mind of [[Masters, Alicia|Alicia Masters]], Aron was ambushed by [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Dr. Doom]], who siphoned-off Aron's power into a containment device. Uatu cared for Aron as his nephew recovered; but before Aron could be tried for his crimes, the Watchers became preoccupied with the threat posed by the giant cosmic entities known as the [[Celestials]]. Aron seized this opportunity to masquerade as his uncle Uatu and manipulate the Fantastic Four into helping him recover the energy stolen from him by Doom. Completing the first phase of his plan, Aron plotted to swallow the entire universe into a black hole and then create a new universe for himself to manipulate. Opposed by the Fantastic Four and [[Fantastic Force]], Aron pitted legions of their past enemies against them, but [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] foiled his scheme by destroying the device needed to create the black hole. In the end, Uatu disciplined his nephew by dissipating his energy and using it to revive the leader of the Watchers known as the One. Uatu was stripped of his title and exiled by the Watchers for these controversial actions. \n\nDespite his expulsion, Uatu continued to observe affairs on Earth, compelled by the lives and struggles of its inhabitants. Eventually reinstated into the Watchers, Uatu witnessed the temporary demise of Galactus, who was destroyed by an intergalactic alliance of [[Glossary:S#super hero|heroes]] led by the [[Silver Surfer]] near the [[Shi'ar|Shi'ar]] homeworld. Soon after, Uatu was viciously attacked by [[Abraxas]], a cosmic entity threatening all of reality, but Abraxas was defeated by the Fantastic Four. Uatu congratulated the heroes, informing them that [[Humans|humanity]] had passed another test. \n\nSome time ago, Uatu and two of his fellow Watchers, Zoma and Qyre, appeared before [[She-Hulk]], who was then serving with the Magistrati as a presiding judge in the [[Living Tribunal|Living Tribunal's]] Cosmic Claims Court. Qyre had discovered a reclusive race who had kept their existence secret since time immemorial. The reclusive race sued the Watchers in the Cosmic Claims Court, and She-Hulk ruled that Qyre's mouth be permanently sealed so that he could not share his knowledge of the plaintiffs with his fellow Watchers.\n\nMost recently, Uatu the Watcher appeared before the costumed heroes. They were at a meeting to discuss what to do after the [[Civil War|incident at Stamford]]. As Watchers only show up personally to monitor key events in history, his presence did not bode well for the costumed heroes.",
