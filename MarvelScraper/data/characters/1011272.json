His powers are tied somehow with his twin sister's (Imp), as physical distance from her will not allow either of their powers to operate.",

Rory convinced Pandora to follow him in becoming [[Glossary:S#super-hero|super-hero]] champions, although Pandora was definitely less interested in such escapades.\n\nOne such excursion brought the twins upon a battle between the scientific organization [[A.I.M.]] and lackeys of the [[Glossary:M#mutate|mutated]] being [[Lenz]]. The twins tried to stop them by taking the object of their dispute, the [[Gryphon]], but soon fled the scene. Pandora's cape was stolen during the battle, and this caused the existence of the Clan to be revealed, and Lenz sent his agents to systematically kill the Destine family members. Pandora and Rory were soon told of their legacy, and the family eventually stopped the [[Glossary:S#super-villain|villain]].\n\nWalter tried to force the children to stop using their powers as crime fighters, prompting Rory to run away with Pandora's help (since they needed to be together to have their powers activated.) The twins helped stop an assassination attempt on their Clan sister, [[Cuckoo (Kay Cera)|Cuckoo]], and Walter reluctantly agreed to allow the children to fight crime with a chaperone.\n\nRory was on hand when the [[Demons|demon]] [[Synraith]] pitted the mutant heroes of the [[X-Men]] against the ClanDestine in order to free himself. Synraith even tempted Rory and Pandora to join the X-Men, but was ultimately destroyed and the two teams soon parted under amiable terms.",
