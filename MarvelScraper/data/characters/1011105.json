        "bio": "During the 1950s, no FBI Agent had as distinguished career as Jimmy Woo, the prime agent involved in battling the villainy of the [[Yellow Claw]]. Be they mutant psychics, hypnotists, microscopic armies, giant robots, or killer mutated sea gulls, all of Yellow Claw's plans were foiled by Jimmy Woo. And despite the animosity toward his archenemy, Jimmy Woo had fallen in love with his grandniece, [[Jade Claw|Suwan]], who was kept from joining her love by the Claw's control. Still, Suwan sometimes managed to help Jimmy thwart her granduncle's nefarious schemes. \n\nIn 1958, the FBI granted Jimmy special powers to assemble a small, secret team of super-powered beings in order to rescue [[Eisenhower, Dwight|President Eisenhower]] from the clutches of the Claw. Jimmy recruited [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Marvel Boy]], [[Venus]], the [[Human Robot]], and [[Gorilla Man (Kenneth Hale)|Gorilla-Man]], successfully freeing the President and forced the Claw to escape. These \"G-Men\" operated for another six months, until the government decreed that the country wasn't ready to learn of such a super-team and its exploits. \n\nIn 1959, Jimmy Woo was promoted to join [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], although it took him out of field work. Years later, he jumped at the chance to return to the field, joining [[Fury, Nick|Nick Fury]] and [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] to stop the Claw from making Suwan into a being powerful enough to be called his successor. Ultimately, Suwan turned on her granduncle, who forced her to relinquish her power, killing her but restoring his ailing health. Jimmy, brokenhearted, returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. duty. \n\nNearing retirement age, Jimmy became a part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Directorate. Secretly, however, he and selected agents had worked without S.H.I.E.L.D. knowledge to track down the [[Atlas Foundation]]. He ran into some trouble, however, and his entire team was decimated when opening a secret Foundation chamber.  Jimmy himself was mortally wounded, which prompted S.H.I.E.L.D. to investigate. Gorilla-Man was brought in to answer questions, but he instead spearheaded a reunion of Jimmy's allies. Marvel Boy's alien technology revived Jimmy-- but with a catch. Jimmy was revived as he was in the 1950s, because that was the way Marvel Boy last remembered him. \n\nWith no memory of recent years, Jimmy Woo and his allies began the search for the Atlas Foundation anew, recruiting S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Agent [[Khanata, Derek|Derek Khanata]] along the way. They began cracking down on various Atlas fronts, all insidious and formidable. The trail led back to the scene of the massacre that started it all, but now Jimmy realized the true secret of the underground passage.\n\nJimmy and his allies were confronted by Mr. [[Lao]] of the Atlas Foundation, a literal dragon working on behalf of Golden Claw. The Claw knew Jimmy to be a true descendant of Genghis Khan, and he revealed that he became Jimmy's greatest enemy in order to help Jimmy build a legend worthy of his lineage. He hoped that Jimmy would take up the mantle of the Khan, restoring his Eternal Empire to its former glory. In fact, Jimmy's adventures with his allies had been set up by the Claw and Mr. Lao from the very beginning, ever since the 1950s! \n\nJimmy reached out to take the spirit banner of the Khan, declaring himself the leader of the Eternal Empire and the Atlas Foundation. However, he professed his determination to use such resources for the betterment of the world. He and his [[Agents of Atlas]] would become a clandestine force for good.",
