These cosmic parasites began to destroy everyone in their path, even the Red King's own men. This atrocity caused Caiera to join the hulk and his allies. These six warriors took on the name of Warbound (which explained their circumstances), they battled ferociously to free the Spikes from the Red King's control, soon after that victory the Hulk defeated the Red King and married Caiera.\n\nHulk became king, and he and Caiera were to have a son. All seemed well, and the Hulk would have a life free from violence and rage. In an unexpected turn of events, the shuttle which brought Hulk to this strange world exploded, killing millions including Caiera. The Hulk's fury was unleashed as never before, and he wanted revenge on those he held responsible. The Warbound vowed to stand at Hulk's side and traveled with him to [[Earth]]. Together, the Warbound defeated members of the [[Illuminati]], [[Avengers]], [[Fantastic Four]], and a slew of other super-powered individuals who inhabit the planet. It wasn't until one of their own was revealed to be a traitor, deliberately causing the destruction on Sakaar just so Hulk would continue to fight, that the war ended. Miek was beaten nearly to death by the Hulk when his treachery was revealed, and the rest of the Warbound were taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody after Hulk surrendered. After [[World War Hulk|the war]] had ended, the Warbound had a chance to redeem themselves when an expanding chasm the Hulk created threatened to destroy the city of New York. The Warbound helped their former enemies avert the disaster but then escaped in the confusion. \n\nThe Warbound eventually ended up in the clutches of the [[Leader (Samuel Sterns)|Leader]] and stuck inside his [[Gammaworld]] dome. While inside, the Warbound proved to be heroes despite their initial intentions upon arriving on the planet when they saved numerous lives from both the radiation slowly poisoning them and from [[Horde (Gammaworld)|Horde]] - a gamma spawned creation of the Leader's. Hiroim even made the supreme sacrifice and gave up his life to stop the Leader, but a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, [[Waynesboro, Katherine|Kate Waynesboro]] inherited his [[Glossary:O#Old Power|Old Power]] and became part of the Warbound.",
