        "weapons": "Omega Red's arms contain retractable Carbonadium coils, each at least 6 ft long, which he can extend at will from openings in the underside of his wrists.  The coils can ensnare victims, crush them with superhuman force, & directly transmit death spores via touch.  The coils enable him to minimize or intensify the spores' effects as desired, but radioactive upsurge from overuse debilitates him, putting him at risk of death from his own spores.  As a result, he must drain life force from his victims to remain fully empowered.  Later experimentation increased his healing factor to undetermined levels, perhaps even enough to stabilize his powers with the C-Synth.",

Eventually [[Wolverine]] hid the C-Synth in the grave of Janice Hollenbeck, a double agent slain by Omega Red.\n\nDespite the C-Synth's theft, the USSR continued employing Omega Red as a super-operative in the KGB (Komitjet Gosudarstvjennoj Bjezopasnosti/Committee for State Security), using him against, among others, friends & family of the mutant [[Katu Kath]], whose powers disrupted Soviet satellite transmissions.  Without additional Carbonadium poisoning or death by his own spores; he was thus required to drain life force from any available victims to survive.  Although a murderer many times over, Red hated being unable to select his victim & kill them at leisure as he had while a serial killer.  At some point he was, at least in his estimation, betrayed by fellow KGB agent [[Olinka Barankova]].  Eventually, he escaped custody & partially reverted to his pre-mutated appearance.  He committed several murders throughout Europe before Interpol agent Sean Cassidy (later [[Banshee]]), assisted by \"Eric Lehnsherr\" (Max Eisenhardt, later [[Magneto]]), tracked him to Ireland.  Aware that the Russian government would experiment on him further if captured, Red invited Cassidy to kill him; when Cassidy refused, red unleashed death spores upon Cassidy's associate, [[Inspector Magrite Deveraux]], who fell to her death despite Cassidy's efforts.  Enraged, Cassidy shot Red several times, disabling , but not killing him.  Red was returned to Russian custody, his crimes concealed by government deceptions, but his continued inability to fully contain his death spores ultimately led his andlers to place him in suspended animation.\n\nIn recent years, Japanese criminal [[Matsuo Tsurayaba]], hired by the [[Fenris]] twins (Andrea & Andreas Strucker), used 20 [[Hand]] ninjas to sacrifice themselves & mystically revive Omega Red.  [[Fenris]] sent Red after the [[X-Men]], & he captured several, including [[Wolverine]], a victory the twins hoped would cement their place in the power-seeking [[Upstarts]] cabal.  Eager for revenge on the former [[Team X]] member, Red battled [[Wolverine]] for hours, ultimately weakening him enough to be contained & mind-probed.  [[Matsuo]], per his bargain with Red, searched [[Wolverine]]'s memories for information on the C-Synth, which Red still sought to remove his vampiric need for life force.  [[Maverick]], having learned of these developments, penetrated [[Fenris]]' base, & when [[Wolverine]] escaped, joined forces with him.  Following a battle with the freed [[X-Men]], Red retreated, [[Wolverine]] & [[Maverick]] subsequently prevented Matsuo from recovering the C-Synth, & [[Wolverine]] entrusted its safety to Maverick.\n\nWeeks later, Omega Red resurfaced in Russia, where fellow mutant [[Soul Skinner]], seeking revenge against the government, mentally enslaved him along with several inhabitants of the town Neftelensk.  Coincidentally, the [[X-Men]] also arrived in Russia seeking their associate [[Magik]] (Illyana Rasputin), imprisoned by a government faction.  Under [[Soul Skinner]]'s control, Red fought the [[X-Men]], but when Skinner was apparently slain by [[Colonel Alexi Vazhin]], Red departed, seeing no benefit in continued conflict.  Evidently having acquired secret data while in Russia, Red searched for [[Olinka Barankova]], whom he believed had been transformed into telepathic mutate [[MODAM]].  His search led him to [[AIM]], where he interrupted a battle between [[Iron Man]] (Tony Stark) & [[MODAM]], who had no memories of their supposed shared past.  [[Iron Man]] defeated both combatants.\n\nRelocating to England, Omega Red resumed his serial killer habits until [[Magneto]]'s [[Acolytes]], including Red's former victim, Katu, offered a cure his life-force addiction in exchange for joining their cause.  After acquiring the necessary information, Red betrayed the [[Acolytes]] & gathered the cure's components on his own, battling [[Cable]] (Nathan Christopher Charles Summers aka Nathan Dayspring Askani'son) in the process.  At the [[Acolytes]]' Arctic base, Red prepared for his transformation, not caring that the procedure would unleash his body's death spores across Earth, but Katu teleported Red & himself away, ending the treatment.  Resurfacing in Ireland, Red targeted Sean Cassidy, now headmaster to [[Generation X]] as [[Banshee]], but was defeated by Cassidy's student [[Chamber]] (Jonothan Starsmore).  Escaping again, Red targeted yet another longtime adversary, [[Maverick]], still possessing the C-Synth.  Although stricken with the [[Legacy virus]], [[Maverick]], aided by fellow [[Team X]] alumnus [[John Wraith]], trapped Red in an abandoned [[Weapon X]] facility, & Wraith manipulated military airplanes into bombing the base.  Surviving, even this onslaught, Red temporarily set aside his grudges & became a mercenary.  Employed with other Russian super-agents in [[General Tskarov]]'s capitalist schemes, he fought [[Daredevil]] (Matt Murdock) & [[Black Widow]] (Natasha Romanoff) but was defeated.\n\nWhen [[Sabertooth]] went on a killing spree, news reports of his actions drew Omega Red's attention &, vengeful once more, he battled his old foe for the first time in decades.  Red planned to us his death spores to weaken [[Sabertooth]]'s healing factor & enslave him as a bargaining tool in regaining the C-Synth, believed to be held by [[Elana Ivanova]], a mutant seeking vengeance on [[Sabertooth]].  Ultimately, however, [[Sabertooth]] was too ferocious even for Red, who was forced to flee for his life.  Subsequently hired by crimelord [[Ivan Pushkin]], Red joined Pushkin's efforts to provoke war between the terrorist groups [[Hydra]] & [[AIM]] while stealing their resources for himself.  When [[Maverick]] intervened, however, Red abandoned the endeavor to again pursue both vengeance  & a chance at the C-Synth.  Pushed from a mountaintop in battle with [[Maverick]], he again survived.\n\nIn a rare bout compassion, Omega Red renewed his alliance with both [[Acolytes]] & the [[Fenris]] twins, along with [[Pyro]] (St. John Allerdyce), [[Avalanche]] (Dominic Petros), & [[Feral]] (Maria Callasantos), to seek a cure for the [[Legacy virus]], which had infected a number of Russian mutants.  Believing the [[High Evolutionary]]'s Isotope E to be such a cure, red & his associates battled their quarry's defenders, [[Quicksilver]] & the [[Knights of Wundagore]], but the encounter ended with Red & the others bound in his coils, the [[Acolytes]] abandoning them to their fate.  Unable to cure his countrymen, red returned to Russia & to government service.  When the government lost control of [[Province 13]]'s experimental mutant children, red hunted the most dangerous escapees, again battling the [[X-Men]] in the process.\n\nLater, Omega Red entered organized crime as an enforcer for the General, formerly a high-ranking KGB official.  [[Sabertooth]] recruited Red & cyborg [[Lady Deathstrike]] to attack [[Wolverine]]'s friends & family, & Red, hating [[Wolverine]] even more than he hated [[Sabertooth]], agreed to join forces against their common enemy.  After luring [[Wolverine]] into a trap, however, [[Sabertooth]] teleported away with him, denying Red & [[Deathstrike]] their vengeance.  Rather than dwell on the incident, Red used resources acquired in the General's service to become New York's [[Red Mafia]] kingpin, reveling in political & corporate power.  When [[Maverick]], as [[Agent Zero]], hunted [[Sabertooth]] for his betrayal of & theft from the latest [[Weapon X Project]], Red, not recognizing his longtime enemy, provided information on [[Sabertooth]]'s whereabouts, exacting revenge on his betrayer, but otherwise seemed willing to abandon his vendettas for his new ventures.\n\nAlthough less troubled by his death-spore condition than before, Omega Red apparently realized he might eventually worsen until even the C-Synth could not help him.  Believing a Korean bioweapons firm could provide a cure, he searched for the firm's ironic price, the C-Synth itself, as did [[Wolverine]] for his own reasons.  [[Wolverine]] located [[Maverick]], but Red attacked both men.  Learning [[Maverick]] had left the device with the [[Black Widow]] in Germany, [[Wolverine]] was forestalled by [[SHIELD]] agents, who captured Red in a gel-like substance.  Briefly held by [[SHIELD]], Red was extradited & subjected to inhumane experimentation in the famous [[Red Room]], much as he had been by the KGB so many years before.  His healing factor enhanced, Red fought [[Wolverine]] & his fellow [[X-Men]] [[Colossus]] (Piotr Rasputin) & [[Nightcrawler]] (Kurt Wagner) when they too were captured by the Red Room.  Defeated once more, he was re-imprisoned by [[SHIELD]]. \n\nMost recently, Omega Red was transferred to Vutluga Prison in Russia, where Wolverine eventually arrived during his search for [[Romulus]].  Red attacked him, having been placed there through [[Romulus]]' machinations, & he used the other prisoners as a resource to drain while he fought [[Wolverine]].  [[Wolverine]] used the C-Synth to position Red beneath some prison gates, that he released, trapping Red when they slammed down.  Red escaped shortly after, & tracked the C-Synth & [[Wolverine]] to the Hughesovka Ironworks #5, still in Russia, where he was held captive by the mutant, [[Wildchild]].  He went after the C-Synth, piercing [[Wildchild]] through the throat with one of his coils & cast him into a cauldron of molten iron.  [[Wolverine]] had already escaped by crawling through the hot liquid metal & reached St. Petersburg, Russia 2 days later to receive the [[Muramasa Blade]], a sword forged with all [[Wolverine]]'s rage, sent by request from another old foe & secret agent [[Black Widow]].  [[Wolverine]] used the sword to presumably kill Omega Red.",
