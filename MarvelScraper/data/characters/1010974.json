Kitty and Wolverine returned to the States to find the X-Men wrongly accused of being allied with the terrorist [[Magneto (Ultimate)|Magneto]]. The X-Men became fugitives, and Kitty was forced to grow up fast living on the run.\n\n\nAfter the X-Men cleared their names, Kitty settled in to her new life. Ruled by her hormones, she showed romantic interest in her teammates [[Colossus (Ultimate)|Colossus]] and [[Angel (Ultimate)|Angel]] before setting her sights on [[Iceman (Ultimate)|Iceman]] (Bobby Drake). She was also a big fan of Spider-Man, and when she met him while in New York tracking down the explosive mutant Geldoff, the star-struck Kitty invited the wall-crawler back to the X-Men Mansion to meet Xavier (much to her teammates' chagrin). En route, Geldoff blew a hole in the jet, and Spider-Man was knocked out. Xavier removed his costume while examining him for injuries, and Kitty was intrigued to discover that he was both cute and near her age.\n\n\nKitty subsequently proved herself in combat, downing an attacking Sentinel in Washington and saving teammate [[Rogue (Ultimate)|Rogue]] from the serial killer Sinister, even though she was jealous of [[Iceman (Ultimate)|Iceman]]'s interest in [[Rogue (Ultimate)|Rogue]]. Later, while visiting the Coney Island fair, [[Iceman (Ultimate)|Iceman]] kissed Kitty. [[Rogue (Ultimate)|Rogue]] caught them, knocked Kitty out, and soon left the X-Men to be with [[Gambit (Ultimate)|Gambit]].  Kitty and [[Iceman (Ultimate)|Iceman]] finally became an item during a later trip to Genosha, but she ended the relationship when she found he was still in e-mail communication and in love with [[Rogue (Ultimate)|Rogue]]. Realizing she had been interested in [[Iceman (Ultimate)|Iceman]] because he was attracted to her, not because she wanted to be with him, she decided on a whim to call Spider-Man and asked him out on a date. After a pleasant afternoon of conversation and crime fighting, they became a couple. Kitty has been going into New York on free nights to patrol with Spidey, during which time she often wears a different (non-X-Men) costume.",
