Sinister agreed to help them, as long as he could have a DNA sample from Courier. This DNA sample allowed Sinister to replicate Courier shape shifting abilities, within Sinister’s own body.\n\nBy the early 20th Century, Sinister had cracked the genetic genome and was willing to share the information with Herbert Edgar Wyndham, who would later become the [[High Evolutionary]].\n\nDuring World War II, Sinister worked alongside the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]], collecting as many blood samples as he could. It was during this time that he first saw [[Sub-Mariner]], and was inspired to create a clone of Namor. The clone was experiment [[N2]] and had varied success against the original Namor but was defeated by [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]].\n\nSome time later, Sinister recruited Gambit to gather together the Marauders and ordered the massacre of the [[Morlocks]]. Sinister cloned [[Phoenix (Jean Grey)|Jean Grey]] in the form of Madelyne Pryor, so that [[Cyclops (Scott Summers)|Cyclops]] would have a child with her, which Sinister would view as the ultimate mutant. Ultimately, Cyclops rejected Pryor when Jean returned from stasis, and the youth would be carried to the future, where he would return to present era as [[Cable]]. Sinister's machinations would lead to the event known as Inferno, where Cyclops supposedly killed Sinister with an optic blast, although Sinister resurfaced alive and well, when he revealed that there was a third Summers brother.\n\nSinister was involved in [[Stryfe]]'s attempted assassination of Xavier,, trading Cyclops & Jean Grey to Stryfe in exchange for their DNA. However, Stryfe actually gave Sinister the Legacy Virus, which would terrorize mutant (and eventually human) life, and lead to the deaths of several mutants.\n\nSinister later involved himself with [[X-Man|Nate Grey]] and the mutant [[Threnody]]. He joined the reestablished [[Weapon X]] program as Doctor Robert Windsor, claiming to help mutants escape Weapon X's mutant concentration camp \"Neverland,\" but in reality, he took them to be his test subjects.",
