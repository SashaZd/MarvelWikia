She has a unique ability to maintain tranquility during combat, as if the experience is similar to a Yoga exercise, giving her an advantage over her opponents who allow rage or adrenaline to guide their actions. When impersonating another she can alter her voice, pulse rate and other traits to deceive even superhuman senses and she apparently has sufficient physiological control to repress or alter her scent as necessary. She is either a licensed attorney or has the legal acumen to impersonate one.",
