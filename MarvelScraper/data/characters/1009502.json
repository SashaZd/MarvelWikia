Pierce did so, and, seizing the opportunities presented to him to further his anti-mutant crusade, assumed command of the group himself.\n\nLater, the Reavers were seemingly destroyed by giant robotic Sentinels summoned from the future by the time-travelling mutant Trevor Fitzroy.  However, the Reavers did not die, and were rebuilt by Pierce to assist him in capturing Milo Thurman, a former government employee who possessed incredible natural prophetic abilities.  Pierce intended to transform Thurman into a cyborg Reaver under his control, but his plan was foiled by Thurman's former lover, the mutant mercenary known as Domino.  However, before Domino could destroy the Reavers' base, Pierce managed to download almost 60% of Thurman's consciousness into his own mind.\n\nPierce later returned in Sydney, Australia as a thrall of the psionic entity known as the Shadow King.  Through Pierce, the Shadow King sent the Reavers to capture the X-Man named Rogue, whom the Shadow King sought to make his consort.  However, Rogue's will prevailed, the Shadow King was defeated, and Pierce and the Reavers were taken into custody by the Australian authorities.",
