Several agents of the [[Glossary:M#mutate|mutated]] scientist [[Lenz]] tried to kill William looking for their stolen device. Willaim was soon contacted by his sister, \"[[Cuckoo (Kay Cera)|Cuckoo]],\" who explained the situation, but William hestiated to re-establish his association with the Clan.\n\nNote: The following has been revealed to be a part of a nightmarish dream of Rory, the Crimson Crusader, and may not be actual reality: After the battle with Lenz, the family reorganized on the Destine estate, with Willaim joining them soon after. He helped the Crusader and Imp as a chaperone for various escapades, but he always used a different identity and a different costume (the Nightmangler, for example.) William, at this time, revealed that Cuckoo was not a member of the Destine family and presumably fought Vincent when he was resurrected.",
