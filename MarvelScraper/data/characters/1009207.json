Bridge, now member of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], formed the [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E.]] to investigate X-Force. The two teams starded a battle and Weapon P.R.I.M.E was defeated.\n\nMore recently, G.W. Bridge (along with new and old members) reformed the Six Pack, however, the team disbanded again and many members were arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D..",
