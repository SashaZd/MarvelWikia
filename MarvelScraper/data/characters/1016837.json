Sam always feels like he has something to prove.\r\n\r\nSam’s powers derive from the Nova Force, which is channeled through his helmet. These powers include flight, enhanced durability, and the ability to absorb and release pulses of energy. However, Sam does not know the extent of his powers, let alone how they work.  \r\n\r\nEnthusiastic and immature, Sam’s eagerness can be a blessing and a curse. His personality will constantly clash with Spidey’s as they compete for bragging rights. ",
