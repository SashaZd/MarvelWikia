Debrii made a dramatic debut just as the Warriors were closing the trap, blasting Terrax with a garbage storm which also engulfed her allies; in the confusion Terrax escaped. Team leader [[Night Thrasher]] ordered Debrii and [[Microbe]], another recent recruit, to stay behind while the others pursued Terrax, but Debrii followed anyway. The senior Warriors tracked Terrax to the NuCar Automotive Plant, exposing him as a robotic simulacrum controlled by the [[Mad Thinker]]'s [[Intellectual Robots]] ([[Einstein, Albert (robot)|Einstein]], [[Freud, Sigmund (robot)|Freud]], [[Woolf, Virginia (robot)|Woolf]] and [[da Vinci, Leonardo (robot)|da Vinci]]). Meanwhile Debrii and Microbe arrived at the plant, evaded robotic guards, and found a storage area full of robot parts. Forming a huge humanoid shell around herself, Debrii smashed through the plant, soon demolishing Einstein, da Vinci and Freud. After fighting the [[Corruptor]], the Warriors learned their show had not been picked up. The team disbanded, with Debrii accepting a lift back to New York from [[Nova (Richard Rider)]].",
