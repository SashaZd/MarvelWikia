        "bio": "Lockjaw is a member of the [[Inhumans]] royal family, mutated by the Terrigen Mists into his canine form. He followed along behind the Inhuman [[Crystal]] when she wandered from her family’s hidden base while they searched for their queen, [[Medusa]]. When Crystal met the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] and confused him for an Inhuman, Lockjaw opened the hidden door to their base to let them both in and then teleported away.\n\n\nWhen the rest of the Inhumans, led by [[Black Bolt]], fought the [[Fantastic Four]], Lockjaw appeared as his leader’s command and trapped the [[Thing (Benjamin Grimm)|Thing]] with a steel girder. Even though the Thing bent the girder, he was unable to pry it from Lockjaw’s mouth until the Human Torch flew by and melted it. But Crystal appeared shortly afterwards and announced [[Triton|Triton’s]] capture by the [[Seeker]], and so Lockjaw teleported the Inhumans back to [[Attilan]] while Johnny Storm and Crystal tried to stay together but were torn apart.\n\n\nLockjaw was in Attilan when Black Bolt took his crown back from his brother, [[Maximus]], and reclaimed his leadership of the Inhumans. Later, Maximus tried to kill all of humanity with his atmo-gun, which failed because both Inhumans and humans were of the same race. And Lockjaw was seemingly trapped within Attilan, along with the rest of the Inhumans, when Maximus reversed his machine’s energies in a rage, creating a Negative Zone around the city. But his powers of teleportation allowed him to roam free, and he left the city, wandering the countryside and inadvertently terrorizing the populace; eventually running into the Human Torch and [[Wingfoot, Wyatt|Wyatt Wingfoot]]. The pair tried to train him while he took them on a teleporting trip around the planet, and presumably off it, before sensing danger and returning them to New York in time to join the fight against [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]]; who had stolen the power cosmic from the [[Silver Surfer]].\n\n\nWhen Maximus briefly regained the Inhuman throne, he used his hypnotic science to control Lockjaw and force him to teleport to the Baxter Building and kidnap the newest member of the Fantastic Four: Crystal. But Black Bolt soon freed his people and sent Maximus scurrying to a hidden rocket, freeing Lockjaw.",
