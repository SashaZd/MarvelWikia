The efficiency of Wyngarde's mutation in combat situations much depends on the element of surprise, and her abilities have no effect on mechanical units and detectors. While this limits Wyngarde's direct aggressive capabilities, she is not to be underestimated.

She has since recovered and been recruited by [[Rogue]] for her X-Men mutant rapid reaction force. Wyngarde recently betrayed the X-Men to the mutant villains known as the Marauders. She has since joined the team.\n\nRegan was apparently killed by Wolverine during a battle between the X-Men and the Marauders.",
