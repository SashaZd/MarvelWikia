Talkback quickly took out the Loners with lasers from the Leapfrog and the Runaways escaped with Mancha.\n\nThe Loners set out after the teen heroes and fought them on a movie set. Sister Grimm caused Turbos' armor to malfunction, Ricochet took out Arsenic and Old Lace, and Bruiser took out Chamber and Lightspeed. Darkhawk lost control of himself while fighting Sister Grimm leading to a conflict between Turbo and Darkhawk during which the Runaways escaped. Infighting betwen the group and Darkhawk led to Darkhawk returning to his Powell identity deciding to forego his alter-ego from that point on. Seeking to help the group, the benefactor informed Urich where they could find a ship which had a control panel modeled after Urich's old Goblin Glider.\n\nPowell stayed behind to act as tech support while the Loners set out to find the Runaways again. They were drawn to the Runaways location due to a blast fired by Lucy in the Sky. The Loners followed the blast and discovered them entangled in a battle with [[Ultron]]. Immediately engaging Ultron in a battle, Chamber escorted the Runaways away from the battle area while the others were rescued by a just arrived Darkhawk who blasted Ultron with a force blast which destroyed his robot shell. The Runaways escaped from Chamber and their mysterious sponsor was revealed as former teen sidekick [[Jones, Rick|Rick Jones]]. Jones informed the Loners that he had been told of the Runaways by [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] and had [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Tony Stark]] fix up an old [[Quinjet]] to aid them in the search. Jones then asked the team if they wished to remain as a super-group full-time in order to protect the west coast from menaces such as Ultron. All of the members agreed except Chamber who had vanished.  The Loners' Chamber was later revealed to be a temporally displaced [[Wilder, Geoffrey|Geoffrey Wilder]], who was working with the new [[Pride]]. He had allowed the Runaways to escape so that his group could get revenge upon them later.\n\nA few months later, the Loners re-emerge in Los Angeles, with a new member named [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] who may or may not be up to no good; she is shown doing research on Ricochet on her laptop and convincing Powell to get back into costume to bust up a Mutant Growth Hormone drug dealer facility. Later on, Ricochet uses documents recovered from this facility to investigate another facility, where he happens upon a young woman named [[Hollow]] floating in a glass tube.",
