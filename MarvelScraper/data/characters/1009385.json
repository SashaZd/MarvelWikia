Karnak was enrolled in his father's religious seminary in the Tower of Wisdom, where he trained in various physical and mental disciplines until he was eighteen years old. Azur died in a mysterious undersea mishap. Mander is still a teacher at the seminary.\n\nKarnak was with the Inhuman royal family when [[Crystal]] brought the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] to their hidden headquarters, from where they searched for their queen, [[Medusa]]. When he met the youth he introduced himself by throwing him over his shoulder in a display of Inhuman skill. When Johnny awoke, [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] had returned with Medusa, and it was revealed that the Torch was not an Inhuman as Crystal had thought. After Gorgon and [[Triton]] fought with him, Johnny burned his way out of the hideout to alert the other members of the [[Fantastic Four]].\n\nAlong with the rest of the Inhumans, led by [[Black Bolt]], Karnak fought with the Fantastic Four-initiating the first attack by chopping off a piece of wall and throwing it at the [[Thing (Benjamin Grimm)|Thing]]-until Crystal appeared and announced that Triton had been taken by the [[Seeker]]. Karnak and his fellow Inhumans soon surrounded [[Lockjaw]], who teleported them back to [[Attilan]]: where Black Bolt faced off against his traitorous brother, [[Maximus]]. Black Bolt quickly took his crown back by force and reclaimed leadership of the Inhumans.\n\nBut the Fantastic Four appeared moments later, having followed the Seeker back to the refuge. While Johnny Storm and Crystal ran to each other, and Black Bolt and [[Mister Fantastic]] argued, Maximus fired his atmo-gun, intending to destroy all of humanity. Though when his weapon didn’t work, Medusa deduced that it proved Inhumans and humans were of the same race, which infuriated Maximus. He went out of control and reversed his machine, creating a Negative Zone around Attilan that trapped Karnak and the rest of the Inhumans in, while the Fantastic Four narrowly escaped. While they remained trapped, Karnak became obsessed with breaking the barrier using his skills, but he only succeeded in injuring his hand. Eventually, Black Bolt revealed his secret: that the use of his voice was lethally destructive, and he soon used its power to destroy the barrier that imprisoned them. The Inhumans' Council of Elders soon decreed that the royal family would disperse and go into human society to learn more of it, while the rest of the Inhumans rebuilt Attilan. Black Bolt agreed, and led them out.\n\nBefore too long, Maximus had recovered and used his scientific genius to capture the Inhuman royal family and retake Attilan. However, Black Bolt soon used his powerful voice to break them free and send Maximus scurrying to a hidden rocket.",
