He would normally take those mutants deemed unfit for survival by Apocalypse and perform gruesome experiments, attempting to create an unbeatable army of enhanced mutants for his master.\n\nMcCoy also conducted experiments on himself attempting to make himself the perfect mutant. Instead, he turned himself into a monster known throughout the Breeding Pens as the Dark Beast. During the final days of Apocalypse, following the mutiny by Sinister, McCoy became even more radical in his experiments. Without Apocalypse's Horseman looking over his shoulder, the Dark Beast was free to do as he wished. He burned through thousands of mutants looking for the ideal combination of genetic power. \n\nDuring the final hours of Apocalypse's rule, [[Grey, Jean (Age of Apocalypse)|Jean Grey]] and [[Cyclops (Age of Apocalypse)|Prelate Scott Summers]] freed many of the mutants the Dark Beast kept in his Breeding Pens. These freed mutants rebelled, and the Dark Beast, realizing many of his captives would be looking for revenge, went into hiding. He was found by the [[X-Men (Age of Apocalypse)|X-Men]] when they teleported into Apocalypse's stronghold. The Dark Beast, knowing Apocalypse's kingdom was falling apart, teleported himself into the M'Kraan Crystal, taking his chances on the millions of realities that lay inside of it. \n\nThe Dark Beast traveled back in time and ended up in the main Marvel Universe's reality at the same moment the boy known as [[Legion (David Haller)|Legion]] was attempting to murder [[Magneto (Magnus)|Magneto]]. A young [[Frost, Emma|Emma Frost]] discovered him and they worked together briefly, but the two parted ways. It is believed he is responsible for the creation of the [[Morlocks]] and [[Gene Nation]], as well as many others. \n\nAt one point, the Dark Beast kidnapped the good [[Beast|Hank McCoy]] from the X-Men and entrapped him. The good Beast eventually escaped and returned to the X-Men. The Dark Beast fled. He recently resurfaced in the ruins of Genosha, apparently having joined [[Professor X|Charles Xavier's]] efforts to rebuild the nation.",
