However, Fury forced him to go back. Days later, an infuriated and fed-up Payne dropped all contact with S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nDespite his previous aversion to killing, Frank, now Frank Schlichting, next appeared on the West Coast to make a name for himself as a criminal mercenary. Applying to Eugene Kligger of the now-defunct criminal organization known as the [[Corporation]], Schlichting was outfitted with the armor, equipment, and identity of the Constrictor and became their special operative and hit man.\n\nHis first public mission brought him into conflict with the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]], but the Corporation soon dissolved and left the Constrictor as a freelance criminal. He then ran afoul of [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]]. He sought employment from the criminal financier [[Hammer, Justin|Justin Hammer]] and was ordered alongside other hired criminals to take out [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]], but he was unsuccessful. He next teamed up with [[Sabretooth]] in a partnership, but the two were thwarted by [[Cage, Luke|Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (Daniel Thomas Rand-K'ai)|Iron Fist]]. The Constrictor was invited to join the criminal organization, the [[Serpent Society]], at one point, but he refused, and he embarked on several solo criminal activities, which were stopped by the likes of Captain America and [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]].\n\nThe Constrictor joined another group, the [[Masters of Evil]], under the leadership of the latest [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]]. The Masters sought to pool their resources from various crimes, and soon tried their hands at a worldwide blackmail scheme, but they were all defeated by the [[Thunderbolts]].\n\nMore recently, the villain Sabretooth was left for dead when his [[Glossary:A#Adamantium|Adamantium]]-laced skeleton was ripped from his body by the villain [[Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur)|Apocalypse]]. The Constrictor was forced by the hero [[Gambit]] to give up his coils to save Sabretooth's life, although Frank soon obtained his current [[Glossary:V#Vibranium|Vibranium]] models.\n\nThe Constrictor briefly shared an apartment with two other villains, [[Copycat|Titania]] (actually Copycat in disguise) and [[Deadpool]]. During a rare moment of camaraderie, he revealed that he had a daughter by the name of Mia Payne, although she remains unaware of her father's career as the Constrictor. (Nick Fury had told Payne's family that Payne, whose cover had been as a business executive, had died in a plane crash.)\n\nRecently, the Constrictor has come into a large amount of money. During an armed hijacking, he and fellow villains [[Hobgoblin (Jason Macendale)|Jack O'Lantern]] and the [[Armadillo]] were thwarted by [[Hercules]], who left the Constrictor seriously injured. The Constrictor sued Hercules for damages, and Hercules was convinced by Jennifer Walters, [[She-Hulk]], to do the honorable thing and pay up. With his $168 million in damages, the Constrictor became a member of the idle rich.\n\nAlthough he never felt as if he belonged with such society, Frank Schlicting attended a party hosted by Carlotta LaRosa. This was the event of the year, attended by Tony \"Iron Man\" Stark, Kyle \"[[Nighthawk (Kyle Richmond)|Nighthawk]]\" Richmond, and Carlotta's then-current boyfriend, Ben \"the [[Thing (Benjamin Grimm)|Thing]]“ Grimm. A snubbed debutante who was left off the guest list hired [[Arcade]] to kidnap the party-goers and put them in one of his [[Murderworld]] amusement parks. As a former villain himself, Nighthawk hoped to convince Frank that he could find a new purpose in life, and the Constrictor helped the Thing and Tony Stark rescue the guests.\n\nRecently, Constrictor's arms have been replaced with bionic arms after battling with K.I.A..  These bionic arms allow his fingers to become vine like, he no longer needs his cables.",
