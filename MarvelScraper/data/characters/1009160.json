The experiences there severely traumatized her, and she retains bitter memories of that place. She used her rage to fuel her body building, which she further uses to augment her mutant abilities. \n\nAt some point, she became a member of the [[Marauders (mutants)|Marauders]], a team of superhuman assassins brought together by the [[Glossary:M#mutant|mutant]] thief [[Gambit]] when he was in the employ of the enigmatic [[Mister Sinister]]. On Sinister's orders, the Marauders massacred the underground community of mutants known as the [[Morlocks]]. In the course of the massacre, the Marauders, including Arclight, clashed with various superhuman champions, including the superhuman mutant adventurers known as the [[X-Men]].\n\nArclight and the Marauders originally died during the demonic invasion of Manhattan that came to be known as the \"[[Inferno (event)| Inferno]]\", but Sinister had the technology to clone the Marauders thanks to him retaining samples of their DNA. Thus, Arclight continued to appear among the Marauders in all subsequent activities, including their battles with [[Cable]] and [[X-Man]], each time on behalf of Mister Sinister.\n\nFor a brief time, Arclight served as a member of the [[Femizons]], an all-female superhuman army of the extra-dimensional warrior women, under the alias of [[Superia]]. During this time, Arclight clashed with the super-soldier known as [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] and the mercenary named [[Paladin]].\n\nRecently, Arclight joined the mutant refugee camp on the grounds of the [[Xavier Institute For Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]], but later rejoined Sinister's Marauders in their effort to gain possession of the Messiah Baby.",
