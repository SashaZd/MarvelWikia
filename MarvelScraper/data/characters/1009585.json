During his first outing as the self-styled \"Shocker\" he ran into and defeated [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)]], who became Schultz's nemesis.\n\nSchultz was usually involved in theft or extortion; a typical day in the life of the Shocker would find him knocking over armored cars or trying to hawk items he previously stole. On one particularly ambitious day, the Shocker held New York City for ransom when he blacked out portions of the city to spell out his criminal moniker, then threatened to black out the entire city unless he was paid 1 million dollars. On another he terrified a stockbroker into playing the market, for substantial monetary gain.\n\nThe Shocker has been a member of the [[Masters Of Evil]] and has fought Spider-Man many times. He has proved to be one of Spider-Man's more difficult opponents. The Shocker, being very masterful in his equipment, makes changes accordingly to defeat his enemies.\n\nThe Shocker has severe confidence problems but came back to his original cocky, arrogant self, recently. He once had Spider-Man completely at his mercy but let him go. The Shocker's brief period of shakey confidence appears to be a thing of the past. He was most recently deafeated by the [[Young Avengers]]..",
