Unfortunately, the only place human fights were taking place was in secret in Hell's Kitchen. During his first fight it was obvious he was a superhuman, and Spector beat his opponent severely. Spector fled, afraid for his life, but was tracked down by [[Luke Cage (House of M)|Luke Cage]], who invited him to join his underworld organization. Spector has been by Cage's side ever since.",
