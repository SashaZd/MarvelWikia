In approximately 1000 AD, Odin help found the [[Councils of God Heads]], who interceded when the extraterrestrial [[Celestials]] threatened to cut the gods off from Earth; Odin constructed the unstoppable armored [[Destroyer]] and the [[Odinsword]] should he face the Celestials in battle upon their return. Odin engaged the \"mad titan\" [[Thanos]] in a battle that ended in a stalemate, after Odin mistook Thanos' efforts to cure Thor of warrior madness as an attack upon his injured son. \n\nLater Odin perished during a subsequent battle with Surtur, Thor assumed his father's place and claimed the Odinpower, but it departed from Thor just as [[Ragnarok]] finally came to Asgard. Assuming a child's form, the Odinpower helped lead Thor on a journey to realize how [[Those Who Sit Above In Shadow]] had manipulated Asgard for ages; although Thor could not halt Ragnarok, he prevented Those Who Sit Above in Shadows from exploiting them further. Thor eventually reclaimed the Odinpower and revived all the Asgardians who had fell in Ragnarok, but Odin himself remained deceased. When Thor took an Odinsleep, he went upon a spiritual journey to a land of the dead where he found that Odin was locked in eternal combat with Surtur. Although Thor had the power to release his father, Odin preferred to remain where he was, ensuring that Surtur would never threaten his people.",
