Stone often worked with the government-sponsored [[X-Factor]] team until the Dark Beast had him betray them by capturing their leader, [[Havok]]. Stone later aided Havok against the Dark Beast, freeing himself from servitude. He briefly joined [[Magneto (Magnus)|Magneto]]'s mutant army in Genosha before being captured by the [[Weapon X]] Program and incarcerated in the \"Neverland\" concentration camp. There, he was selected to become a field agent but was ultimately freed after a change in Weapon X's leadership.",
