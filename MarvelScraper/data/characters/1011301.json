When Northstar was killed by a mind-controlled [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]], Victor initially had trouble dealing with his loss but soon learned to cope with help from his new advisor, [[Karma]].\n\nAnole was also taken into Limbo where the New X-Men found and saved Illyana Rasputin.  In the process his right arm was severed at the shoulder.  Anole was suprised that the arm regrew and was much stronger. He, with the help of [[Pixie]] and the other New X-Men, defeated the villain [[Witchfire]].  Upon his return home, Pixie and Anole became members of the New X-Men team.  As a member of the New X-Men team he confided his homosexuality to [[Rockslide]], who was previously unaware.\n\nDuring Hope Summers birth, the X-Men learned that the [[Purifiers]] were involved.  Surge lead the New X-Men on a mission to find out how the Purifiers were involved.  Anole used his camouflage to infiltrate their facility and found out that the Purifiers in fact did not have the baby.  Upon his return to the mansion he helped defend his friends against [[Predator X]].\n\nWhen [[Cyclops]] disbanded the X Men, Victor went to his hometown.  Northstar was alive again and came to talk to Victor about being accepted.  He was surprised to learn that Victor's hometown accepted him for who he was, but his time with the X-Men made him into a warrior instead of a kid.  Victor elbows Northstar in the face as he plans on running away from his civilian life.\n\n[[Moonstar]] convinced Anole to join the Young X-Men in San Francisco.  He aided in the Skrull invasion and was with them when they moved to Utopia.\n\nWhen [[Magik]] was hurt and transported to Limbo during Cable's return from the future with Hope, [[Cannonball]] used Anole to convince Pixie to teleport a team into Limbo to retrieve her.  Anole was a part of that team and was forced to fight his teammates who were corrupted in Limbo's dark energy.",
