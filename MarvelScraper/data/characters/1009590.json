Sable turned the focus of the Wild Pack more and more toward mercenary endeavors, until the group became the major source of outside income for Symkaria. Under the auspices of Silver Sable International, the organization apprehends wanted criminals and recovers stolen property for a wide spectrum of clients from major insurance companies to small nations.\n\nOne such contract was the apprehension of the international jewel thief the [[Black Fox (Raul Chalmers)|Black Fox]] and the return of valuable gems in his possession. Working with the New York City police, the Wild Pack nearly apprehended him, only to be thwarted by the inadvertent actions of [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]]. Eventually Spider-Man recovered the jewels but allowed the thief to escape.\n\nSilver Sable International was later hired by a small South African country to neutralize the international terrorist [[Hobgoblin (Jason Macendale)|Jason Macendale]] (Jack O'Lantern), suspected of training rebel forces within the client's borders. An initial team of Wild Pack members was ambushed by Macendale's men and nearly killed, leading Silver Sable to enlist aid from Spider-Man.\n\nDuring the course of these events, Sable became involved in a daylight robbery that resulted in the death of a young woman, an innocent bystander accompanied by her young son. The woman's death struck a responsive chord in Sable, and she dropped her other activities to hunt down the killer. His trail led to an abandoned building, where Jack O'Lantern chose to attack Silver and her men. During the final confrontation, her choice to capture the killer enabled Jack O'Lantern to escape.\n\nSpider-Man then agreed to help Silver capture Jack O'Lantern. They tracked him to [[Coney Island Amusement Park]], only to be ambushed by the group of costumed criminals called the [[Sinister Syndicate]], the [[MACH-IV|Beetle]], the [[Rhino (Aleksei Sytsevich)|Rhino]], [[Hydro-Man]], [[Boomerang]] and the [[Speed Demon]], who were hired to kill Macendale's pursuers. They nearly succeeded, but were stopped at the last minute by the [[Sandman (William Baker)|Sandman]], who allowed Sable and Spider-Man to escape. After a long battle, the three managed to defeat the criminals, but nothing was found to help them locate Jack O'Lantern.",
