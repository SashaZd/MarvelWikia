During this conflict, Andrea discovered that Citizen V was, in fact, Baron Helmut Zemo, then believed dead, following his decapitation by Nomad, and as a result, Andrea was quickly killed in order to keep this knowledge from being revealed.\n\nA few years later, Andreas reappeared as the Swordsman in the latest incarnation of the [[Thunderbolts]], though his true identity was kept secret for some time.",
