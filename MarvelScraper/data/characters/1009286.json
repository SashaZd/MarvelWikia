Not all was as it seemed, however, as in reality a group of [[Warskrulls]], using technology to allow them to duplicate superpowers, had captured and impersonated [[Professor X|Xavier]], using his [[Glossary:T#telepathy|telepathy]] to control Lilandra and the Imperial Guard, including Earthquake. After the ruse was discovered by the X-Men and all the Warskrull impostors were exposed, Lilandra settled matters with Deathbird, discovering her sister did not want the throne anymore. During her time as ruling Shi'ar Majestrix, Deathbird had come to despise the responsibilities of maintaining the needs of an Empire as large as the Shi'ar's.\n\nDuring the war between the Shi'ar and [[Kree]] Empires, Earthquake was amongst a small contingent of the Imperial Guard that defended their Empress Lilandra against the Kree super-team known as [[Starforce]].\n\nWhen the Empress Lilandra learned of the many Earth heroes that had sacrificed their lives to stop the malevolent psionic being named [[Onslaught (entity)|Onslaught]], she dispatched eight members of the Imperial Guard, including Earthquake, to protect Earth. While on Earth, the Guard uncovered a plot by a militant Kree faction to simulate a radical political activist group in revenge for Earth's involvement in the Kree/Shi'ar war. In reality, the group created a \"nega-reactor\", similar to the [[Nega-Bomb|bomb]] that was used on the Kree. However, this plot was stopped by the Guard, but not before the reactor was used by the Kree's leader, the [[Supreme Intelligence]], to re-incorporate itself after being presumably killed at the end of the war.\n\nSubsequently, Earthquake was amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree [[Ronan]] the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the [[Inhumans]].",
