At maximum the force is equal to that caused by the detonation of a nuclear weapon.  Other possible manifestations of this harnessed electron energy include electron energy blasts, flight, enhanced strength (the \"Master Blow\" being a superhuman punch), ability to survive in space, and the ability to analyze and manipulate matter.  The fork-shaped antenna that Black Bolt has worn upon his brow since childhood enable him to channel his powers in more directed, less destructive ways.

As an infant, he demonstrated certain energy-manipulative powers that he couldn't control, particularly that of producing quasi-sonic energy of great destructive potential. To protect the other Inhumans, he was placed inside a sound-proofed chamber and given an energy-harnessing suit. There he was schooled on how to control his powers until the age of nineteen, when he was allowed to enter society.\n\n\nA month after being awarded his freedom, Black Bolt discovered that his younger brother Maximus had made a pact with emissaries of the [[Kree]]. While attempting to stop the Kree ship before it escaped, Bolt used the power of his quasi-sonic voice to knock the ship out of the sky. When the ship crashed to [[Earth]], it landed on the parliament, killing several key members of the Council of Genetics, including his parents. The reverberations of Bolts shout affected Maximus’ sanity and suppressed his nascent mental powers. Despite his guilt and silent protests, Black Bolt was obligated to accept the mantle of leadership of the Inhumans at age twenty.\n\nBlack Bolt’s first crisis in leadership came when his cousin Triton was held captive by humans. Learning of Triton’s encounter upon his escape, Black Bolt decided that Attilan was in imminent danger of being discovered by humanity. Black Bolt scouted out possible places in which to relocate, and decided upon the remote Himalayan mountains. After the great migration, Black Bolt faced his second great crisis when his now insane brother Maximus unleashed the [[Trikon]], three of the Inhumans’ worker drones who were transformed into energy-beings. The Trikon enabled Maximus to launch a successful coup, establishing his rule over the Inhumans, and sending Black Bolt and the other members of the Royal Family into exile. \n\nFor the next few years, Black Bolt and his kinsmen wandered Asia, Europe, and finally America, in search of Medusa, Bolt's betrothed mate, who had been separated from the others during the battle with the Trikon. Eventually Black Bolt was reunited with Medusa when Gorgon found her in the company of the [[Fantastic Four]]. After leading an attack against the four, Black Bolt returned to Attilan when Crystal announced that his cousin Triton had been taken back by the [[Seeker]]. Black Bolt returned to face his brother, who had taken the crown of the Inhumans, and declared himself the new ruler and the future husband of Medusa. But Black Bolt was not amused by his show of power, and tore the crown from his hands, reclaiming his place as the leader of the Inhumans. Though later, once the Fantastic Four found the refuge, and Black Bolt argued with [[Mister Fantastic]], encouraging him to leave peaceably, Maximus sealed the refuge in a [[Glossary:N#Negative Zone|Negative Zone]] barrier after discovering that Inhumans and humans were of the same race.\n\n[[image: blackbolt01.jpg|right|thumb|200px]]With his brother insane, and the key to the barrier trapped within Maximus' diseased mind, the Inhumans sought frantically for a way to escape the Negative Zone. Black Bolt's first attempt was to use his own energy to empower a bomb that would burst it open, but it almost destroyed the entire city before he used his powerful voice to stop it. Finally, he was forced to expose his secret and again use his destructive voice to demolish the barrier surrounding Attilan, freeing his people. While the rest of the Inhumans rebuilt the city, the Council of Elders ordered that the Royal Family split up and temporarily join humanity. Black Bolt agreed with them; and so, he led them out of the city and they dispersed, with his cousin Crystal eager to rejoin her love, the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]]. After Crystal became a member of the Fantastic Four, Maximus recaptured the throne using his hypno-drugs, and captured Black Bolt and the rest of the Royal Family. But Black Bolt eventually realized there was no other way, and used the power of his voice, again, to break them free and send Maximus fleeing away in a hidden rocket, along with a small group of Inhumans. Later, Black Bolt ordered Crystal back when a radiation experiment injured him, so that she could use her powers to vibrate his heart and keep him alive until Gorgon could return and heal him. Finally, Crystal was forced to return to her family permanently when it was discovered that Earth's pollutants were poisoning them, as they had built up no immunity to them.\n\nBlack Bolt has proved adept at leading the Inhumans through some of the most turbulent times in their history; including several more attempts by Maximus to usurp the throne, revolts by the worker class, attacks by human renegades, the kidnapping of Medusa, the destruction and rebuilding of Attilan, the revelation of the Inhuman existence to humanity, and finally the second relocation of Attilan. Following the traditionally lengthy period of betrothal, Black Bolt and Medusa were wed.",
