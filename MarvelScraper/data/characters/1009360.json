By generating force from within this fluid, he can emit high-pressure water blasts like a fire hose. Bench mentally controls every drop of his bodily liquid; his watery form will gradually reintegrate if it has been vaporized or otherwise dispersed. He can merge with or absorb ordinary, existing water in his environment, often using it to increase his mass and volume. Bench's strength is slightly enhanced by his abnormal physiology. Recent alterations of his powers by the Wizard have enabled Bench to mentally manipulate water sources outside his own body, and have given him a finer degree of control over his own fluid form. However, the Wizard also intentionally weakened Bench's molecular cohesion, and developed a device enabling him to reduce Bench to an inert mass of liquid if necessary, ensuring Hydro-Man's loyalty.",

Physically and emotionally unstable, Bench dubbed himself Hydro-Man and soon attacked Spider-Man, but he evaporated after Spider-Man scattered his liquid form amidst the hot sunshine of the New York rooftops; however, the particles of Bench's body soon reintegrated, and he embarked on a long criminal career. \n\nWhen Bench and rival criminal [[Sandman (William Baker)|Sandman]] fought over the affections of barfly Sadie Frickett, the two men accidentally merged into a monstrous \"mud-thing\" that the police were ultimately forced to dehydrate into seemingly inert rubble.[[image: Hydro man .JPG|thumb|200px|left]] Hydro-Man and Sandman eventually managed to separate back into their original forms, but both were humiliated and traumatized by the experience. Sandman was so shaken that he went straight for years (until the [[Wizard]] brainwashed him into returning to crime), while Hydro-Man did most of his criminal work in groups from that point on, perhaps seeking safety in numbers. \n\nBoth alone and as a member of teams like the [[Sinister Syndicate]], the [[Frightful Four]] and the Assembly of Evil, Bench fought a wide array of foes such as [[Silver Sable]], Sandman, the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Cloak]] & [[Dagger]], the [[Avengers]], the [[New Warriors]], [[Thunderstrike]], the [[Thunderbolts]], [[Gambit]] and [[Black Panther (T'Challa)|Black Panther]], but most often clashed with Spider-Man. Hydro-Man was one of many super-criminals employed by corrupt billionaire Justin Hammer for a time, and later served in the [[Masters of Evil]] assembled by Hammer's daughter Justine, alias the Crimson Cowl; however, after Justine's arrest and the apparent death of Justin, Hammer Industries phased out its criminal enterprises and Bench, along with fellow employee the Shocker, was laid off. The Shocker and Hydro-Man then teamed up for one last crime, seeking enough money to retire, but Hydro-Man's thirst for revenge against Spider-Man led to their defeat. Trying and failing to go straight, Bench was recruited back into the Wizard's Frightful Four and, more recently, the [[Sinister Twelve]].",
