After the war was over, Union Jack was retired, and Falsworth settled back into life at Falsworth Manor and began to raise his family.\n\nDuring World War II, Baron Blood returned to the countryside near Falsworth Manor to begin a new reign of terror. Montgomery's daughter, [[Spitfire|Jacqueline]], was attacked by the vampire, but saved by the original [[Human Torch (Jim Hammond)|Human Torch]], who drove it off. Jacqueline invited the Torch and his team, the [[Invaders]], to dinner at the manor, where Falsworth then revealed to family and company that there was one other super-hero in their midst — himself! He told of his career during World War I as Union Jack and volunteered the use of his mansion as a base of operations for the Invaders. He was even inspired to don the Union Jack identity to fight alongside the Invaders against Baron Blood. During the battle, Falsworth finally discovered the identity of the vampire was his brother, John, only to have his brother crush his legs under a boulder. He managed to pry to boulder off, which subsequently knocked Baron Blood onto a stalagmite, impaling him. Although paralyzed from the waist down, he did accompany the Invaders on a mission into Germany, where he met and reconciled with his son [[Union Jack (Brian Falsworth)|Brian]], who he had thought fled to German as a Nazi sympathizer. He offered his son the mantle of Union Jack, passing on the legacy.\n\nYears later, Falsworth outlived his son, who died in a car accident. Growing ill with age, his daughter came to live at Falsworth Manor to help assist him. At this time, Falsworth read about a series of murders, strongly believing that a revived Baron Blood was behind them. He contacted [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] for help and devised a plan where Falsworth would don the Union Jack garb to draw the vampire out. Unfortunately, Falsworth suffered a heart attack before the confrontation, and his place in the trap was taken by his grandson's friend [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Joe Chapman]]; Chapman and Captain America together defeated the vampire. The heroes committed Baron Blood’s body to a funeral pyre, at which time Falsworth quietly passed away, knowing his brother’s evil had been laid to rest.",
