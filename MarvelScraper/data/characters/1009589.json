One evening, Sabretooth attacked Silver Fox, apparently raping her and leaving her for dead. Enraged, Logan fought Sabretooth in a savage battle but was defeated and left town, unaware she had survived.\n\n\nDecades later, Silver Fox became an operative of the U.S. Government’s Weapon X Program, joining the field unit known as Team X where she was reunited with both Logan, now known as Wolverine, and Sabretooth. Since the members of Team X were all subject to memory alterations, it is unclear how much of their past involvement the three remembered at the time. As a result of an extreme reaction to her memory implants, Silver Fox betrayed Wolverine and Sabretooth on a mission in Cuba in 1963. She subsequently became a terrorist, clashing with her former teammates on another mission in Ontario, and eventually she became an agent of the international terrorist group Hydra.\n\nYears later, Silver Fox monitored Wolverine’s quest for answers about the Weapon X Program, and she killed the Weapon X scientist called the Professor to prevent his interference. She subsequently allied with the leader of the ninja clan the [[Hand]], [[Tsurayaba, Matsu'o|Matsu’o Tsurayaba]], and hired the Japanese assassin Reiko to poison Wolverine’s beloved, [[Yashida, Mariko|Mariko Yashida]]. When the former Team X member [[Mastodon]] rapidly aged and died, Silver Fox gathered Wolverine and the other remaining Team X alumni to seek answers. Their search led them to Aldo Ferro, the same man who had crafted Team X’s memory implants decades ago. During the course of the confrontation, Silver Fox was slain by Sabretooth, and Wolverine buried her near the cabin where they had found happiness so long ago.",
