The Shi'ar quarantined the Mephitisoids on their homeworld under martial law, fostering a bitter hatred of the Shi'ar and leading to numerous revolts.\n\n\nCenturies later, imprisoned in the Slave Pits of Alsibar, Hepzibah encountered the human Christopher Summers. Her torture at the hands of her jailers caused Summers to rebel alongside Hepzibah, [[Ch’od]], Cr+eee, and [[Raza|Raza]]. The quintet escaped the Pits, stole a starship, and went on to form the Starjammers, a team of interstellar pirates led by Summers - as the swashbuckling [[Corsair|Corsair]] - who operate mostly within the Shi'ar Galaxy. Hepzibah was given her alias by Corsair named after a beautiful female skunk in an Earth comic strip.\n\n\nDuring her time as the Starjammers' weapons officer, Hepzibah and Corsair fell in love, and it was not long before she took him as her mate and the pair were bonded for life. However, Hepzibah's long-festering hatred of the Shi'ar strained her relationship with Corsair. While aiding the Shi'ar against the threat of the alien Uncreated, Corsair was forced to re-route control of Hepzibah's weapons station in order to prevent her from firing on a Shi'ar ship. After the battle, all criminal charges against the Starjammers were dropped by Shi'ar Empress [[Lilandra|Lilandra]]. Seizing the opportunity, Corsair chose to retire with Hepzibah and live a normal life. Their happiness was cut short, though, after they and the other Starjammers were captured by [[Collector|the Collector]]. They escaped with the help of the [[X-Men|X-Man]] [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]] and resumed their pirating ways.",
