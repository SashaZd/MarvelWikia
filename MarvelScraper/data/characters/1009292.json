After years of imprisonment, Marius—now calling himself Emplate—eventually learned to traverse the dimensional barrier and returned to Earth, where he employed the dwarven D.O.A. as a manservant.\n\nLearning of the powerful mutant [[Chamber]], Emplate intercepted him upon his arrival in the U.S., but was driven off by the [[Generation X]] students. Among their number were Marius’ younger sisters, who had used their powers to merge into [[M (Monet St. Croix)|M]], a single being resembling Monet. After Penance escaped and joined Generation X, Emplate sought to recapture her and so enslaved several mutants, as well as Chamber’s former girlfriend, Lady Gayle Edgerton. Emplate and his “Hellions” attacked and captured Generation X, but were defeated thanks to the [[X-Men|X-Man]] [[Bishop]], who noted that hordes of Emplate-like creatures existed in his future time. Before his defeat, Emplate enslaved Generation X member [[Synch]] and sent him to attack his own family; however, Synch ultimately fought off Emplate’s influence. Later, Emplate and the twins were temporarily fused into a new being named M-Plate, who allied with the superhuman bounty hunter [[Chimera (pirate)|Chimera]] in an attempt to gain control of the Universal Amalgamator, a device that could merge all sentient beings in the universe into a single consciousness. Their plan was thwarted by Generation X, and Emplate and the twins were all separated by the mutant [[Dirt Nap]]. While merged with their brother, the twins learned of Monet’s true fate, and subsequently used their powers to merge with Penance and free her, becoming [[Penance (Claudette and Nicolette St. Croix)|Penance]] in her stead.\n\nA weakened Emplate later returned and attacked Generation X, but was defeated by a massive explosion generated by [[Jubilee]] which also forced the twins out of their Penance form, creating a third [[Penance (unrevealed)|Penance]] whose identity remains unknown but is suspected of being related to the St. Croix siblings. Emplate was subsequently held within the Academy’s infirmary until the school was all but destroyed during a riot, during which Emplate presumably escaped.",
