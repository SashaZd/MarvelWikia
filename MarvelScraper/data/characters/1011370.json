Peter Parker, as [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], was forced to nearly miss his high-school graduation to stop the Molten Man's first crime spree.\n\nAfter graduating high school, [[Osborn, Liz|Elizabeth Allan]] worked as a nurse to aid Raxton, her step-brother. It was only after Molten Man made an attempt to attack her, he realized that his step-sister was the only member of his family who had not abandoned him. After desperate attempts to cure himself involving criminal activities, Raxton ended up in the [[Vault]], the superhuman prison in the Colorado Rockies.\n\nYears later, reconciling with Raxton, Liz and her husband [[Green Goblin (Harry Osborn)|Harry Osborn]] gave Raxton a job as head of security at [[Osborn Industries]]. Raxton supported Liz when Harry went back his villainous ways and later helped Spider-Man to capture him. Molten Man and Spider-Man have since become friends, but when [[Reilly, Ben|Ben Reilly]] assumed the role of Spider-Man they have minor disagreement until they allied themselves against [[Stromm, Mendel|Gaunt]].\n\nRaxton also crossed paths with [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]] when he was affected by a gas made by [[Mister Fear (Lawrence Cranston)|Mister Fear]]. Daredevil managed to dispose the gas before he managed to hurt anyone and revealed that Raxton was betrayed by one of his own people. \n\nSome time after that, Molten Man was abducted by Norman Osborn, the original [[Green Goblin (Norman Osborn)|Green Goblin]], and was brainwashed. Under mind control, Molten Man attacked and killed Osborn's henchwoman [[Mongrain, Alison|Alison Mongrain]], who happened to be one of the few people who knew the true cause [[Watson-Parker, Mary Jane|Mary Jane]]'s miscarriage. While Molten Man has since recovered from the mind control, he still bears a heavy burden of guilt over the incident.\n\nSometime after [[Civil War|Superhero Registration Act]] came a law and Spider-Man had publicly revealed his identity. [[Chameleon]] recruited [[Scarecrow (Ebenezer Laughton)|Scarecrow]], [[Will-O'-The-Wisp]], [[Electro (Maxwell Dillon)|Electro]] and [[Swarm]] to the group he himself called [[Exterminators]]. He then blackmailed Raxton to join the group by threatening to hurt a child who he was mentoring. They made Liz call Spider-Man to come her apartment by threatening to hurt [[Osborn, Norman Jr.|Normie]]. When Spider-Man arrived with [[Black Cat]] they were attacked by Raxton, Will-O'-The-Wisp and Scarecrow. Spider-Man and Black Cat managed to beat them and Spider-Man made Raxton tell them where Chameleon was. He told that Chameleon was after [[Parker, May (Aunt May)|Aunt May]]. Raxton apparently was arrested shortly after Spider-Man and Black Cat left to rescue Aunt May.",
