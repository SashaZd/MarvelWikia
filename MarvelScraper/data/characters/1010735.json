        "bio": "A former saxophonist, Arthur Sampson \"Art\" Douglas and his family were killed by the Titanian Eternal [[Thanos]] while driving across the Mojave Desert. Kronos recovered Douglas' astral form and used it to create a superhuman warrior for the purpose of defeating Thanos. After Thanos was defeated, Drax was eventually killed by a psychic attack from [[Moondragon]].\n\nYears later, Drax was resurrected to once again battle Thanos (also recently resurrected). Drax's resurrection was not perfect, however; his brain remained damaged from his previous death. After Thanos was defeated a second time, Drax became a member of the [[Infinity Watch]] and guardian of the Power Gem.\n\n[[Warlock, Adam|Adam Warlock]], leader of the Watch, shut off Drax's hunger to kill Thanos when he had the Infinity Gauntlet. However Moondragon accidentally caused some of his memories to resurface, and returned to him his insane hunger to kill Thanos.\n\nDrax partially regained his intelligence when he and his daughter Moondragon petitioned Kronos, the being who had resurrected Arthur Douglas as Drax, to restore his mind and heal the severe injuries Moondragon had suffered. Moondragon gave up some of her mental prowess and Drax gave up some of his bulk to heal one another. The recovery took time, and Drax was for a while still dim-witted (but nowhere near as badly as he was before), undergoing tutoring by his daughter. Drax was taken to the [[Microverse]] where he was mistaken for the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]] and helped the [[Microns]] overthrow the [[Psycho-Man]] and [[Fredd]], an evil clone of [[Photon (Genis-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]. Drax decided to remain there and help the Microns rebuild the Microverse's government.\n\nDrax battled the [[Fallen One (Tryco Slatterus)|Champion]] for control of a planet that Champion had taken over. Drax lost the battle, but the Champion was later defeated by [[She-Hulk]].\n\nRecently, as a detainee aboard a galactic prison transport, Drax crashed on Earth and escaped imprisonment, along with the other inmates. He regained his intelligence and fought the other inmates when they threatened the local townsfolk and the 10 year old girl named [[Cammi]], who befriended him. Drax and Cammi were then taken to an intergalactic prison known as the [[Kyln]]\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time the being known as [[Annihilus]] attacked Kyln. Having survived, Drax and Cammi team-up with [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]. During their time together Drax teaches Nova how to better harness the [[Nova Force]] and how to kill. Eventually Drax and Cammi join Nova's [[United Front]] and oppose Annihilus. During a crucial battle Drax is once more confronted by Thanos, who is trying to save [[Galactus]]. However, before Thanos could free Galactus, Drax managed to punch a hole through the Mad Titan's chest, killing him. Realizing his mistake he uses the power of the [[Silver Surfer]] to save Galactus. Once freed Galactus teleported both Drax and Moondragon to an undisclosed location. From there Drax vanished.\n\nSometime after the war with Annihilus, the [[Phalanx (species)|Phalanx]] managed to take over [[Kree]] Space and infect many worlds. Now trapped within Kree Space, Drax was hunted by a Phalanx infected Nova and [[Gamora]]. During the chase Nova was able to capture Drax and he was then infected with the techno-organic virus, becoming a Phalanx Select. Now working for the Phalanx he was recently given the assignment to hunt down and capture or kill Nova, who escaped from the Phalanx's grasp. Following Nova into a wormhole, Nova, Gamora, and Drax are now stranded in an unknown quadrant of space.\n\nAfter the events of the Annihilation Conquest, Drax agreed to join a group of cosmic heroes to form a proactive line of defense against potential treats to the Universe. The group was led by [[Jason of Spartoi]]’s son Peter Quill, also known as the [[Star-Lord (Peter Quill) |Star-Lord]]. After many failed attempts of coming up with a name, [[Rocket Raccoon]] suggested that they take the name of [[Guardians of the Galaxy]]. The team used [[Knowhere]] as their base of operation. Knowhere is located inside the decapitated head of an unidentified [[Celestials|Celestial]] that was floating on the very edge of the universe. \n\nWhile on Knowhere, Drax would come into conflict with the [[Luminals]] who were the protectors of this peaceful place. Drax and the Guardians first mission pitted them against the [[Universal Church of Truth]] which was a group of very powerful religious fanatics. Later during the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull infiltration]] that destroyed the Continuum Cortex, [[Cynosure (female)|Cynosure]] sent her team after the missing Drax, when it was suspected he could be a [[Skrull]]. Three of her finest, [[Massdriver]], [[Impact]] and [[Brightstorm]], were left defeated and in intensive care following a furious battle with the Destroyer. When questioned about his mysterious disappearances by [[Quasar (Phyla-Vell)|Quasar]], Drax revealed that he had been using the Continuum Cortex to search for Cammi.",
