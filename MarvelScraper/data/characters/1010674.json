Anita also has a bachelor's degree in preternatural biology.\n\nBut Anita Blake is better known for her other profession ­ vampire hunting. Nicknamed \"the Executioner\" by the vampire underworld, Anita has worked with both the police and other hunters to bring violent vampires to justice. In the early days, she only needed evidence of violence to do her job. But since the decision of the United States Government to declare vampires, lycanthropes, and other undead and supernatural beings as legal citizens, the rules for vampire execution have become stricter, and Anita often requires a warrant before she can kill a vampire.\n[[image:Anita-n-friends.jpg|center|420px]]",
