        "bio": "After his Mother suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized, Robert Farrell began to feel the financial strain on his family. His talent for science and technology seemed to indicate a promising future, however, he designed a weapon equipped costume and a super charged skateboard only to turn to a life of crime as a means of making some fast cash. Early on in Farrell’s crime spree, Rocket Racer was brought down by [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], which inspired him to look for aid in the form of the [[Tinkerer]]. The two of them augmented Rocket Racer’s weapons, but again he was defeated by Spider-Man, and taken in front of a judge. Farrell’s bail was paid by an unknown benefactor who eventually forces Rocket Racer to a life of crime once more. This time, with Spider-Man’s help, Rocket Racer puts an end to his criminal ways as the two of them save each other’s lives from the bondsman’s hired thug, the [[Bounty Hunter (modern)|Bounty Hunter]]. Farrell was given a light sentence, and after serving his time he receives a scholarship to Empire State University.\n\nEventually Farrell donned the Rocket Racer persona once again, but this time he was on the side of the angels. One such heroic deed includes the time he helped Spider-Man take down a neo-Nazi fascist called [[Skinhead]]. In time, he even joined with other reformed criminals such as [[Puma]], [[Sandman (William Baker)|Sandman]], [[Will-O'-The-Wisp]], and [[Prowler (Hobie Brown)|Prowler]] to form the [[Outlaws]]. Together they have helped Spider-Man, and became contract employees for [[Silver Sable]] on a number of occasions.  \n\nRocket Racer was last seen oppossing [[Civil War|Registration]] forces.",
