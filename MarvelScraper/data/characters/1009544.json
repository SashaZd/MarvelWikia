Risque began a romantic affair with the mutant in hopes of luring him back to her employer.  Despite developing genuine feelings for Warpath, she drugged him and delivered him to Sledge.\n\n[[X-Force]], led by a jealous [[Siryn]], hunted Risque down to an amusement park called Wackyworld.  She nearly successfully evaded the group, but she reluctantly aided X-Force's Caliban when he seemed to suffer from a nervous system attack and was eventually captured.  Risque then led the group to Warpath's, who angrily rejected Risque upon the discovery of her deceptive ways.  Risque subsequently checked on Warpath, but he was on a mission for Sledge.  Later, Risque teamed with the Vanisher to steal the Heart of Pele, a sacred jewel, in Hawaii.  Risque was then impersonated by the goddess Pele, but the true Risque was discovered and reunited with X-Force, who no longer seemed to bear hard feelings on the troublesome mutant.\n\nRisque aided X-Force several other times, including battles against the ethereal Demon Bear where Risque and Warpath finally had a chance to reunite.\n\nRisque later joined X-Corporation, an international version of the X-Men created by Charles Xavier.  Stationed in Hong Kong alongside former X-Force member [[Domino (Neena Thurman)|Domino]], Risque was killed shortly after joining when the [[U-Men]] murdered her after she attempted to stop the selling of mutant body parts to be transplanted into regular humans. \n\nRecently, Risque was revived with an alien techno organic virus.",
