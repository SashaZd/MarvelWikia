He was more than willing to get revenge and received power from Ryker's [[Ross-Banner, Betty|Harpy]] experiments.",

He was more than willing to get revenge and received power from Ryker's [[Ross-Banner, Betty|Harpy]] experiments.  \n\nRyker sent the Corps to kill his former lackey [[Flux]], and then set them against the Hulk, who had [[World War Hulk|waged war on the heroes of Earth]] – namely the members of the [[Illuminati]] – for sending him to another planet against his will. Hulk's ship went off course, and he landed on a violent world where he suffered numerous trials before finding a queen who would bear him a child. However, the ship that brought Hulk to the planet of [[Saakar]] exploded and killed most of his new world, including his wife. The Hulk's anger was like never before, and his strength was greater than it had ever been. The Gamma Corps was not ready for this new incarnation of the Hulk and despite the fact that a concentrated attack led their field leader Grey to snap the Hulk's neck, the Hulk quickly recovered, fought back and tracked them to their base in the Staten Island Dump. The Corps was were beaten both physically and mentally, and the Hulk forced each member to face their personal demons. Deciding Hulk was not to blame for their misfortunes, the Corps turned on Ryker for lying to them about Hulk's involvement in the tragedies that changed their lives and to avenge the untold number of volunteers who perished because of his experiments. The Corps destroyed his base and struck out on their own, targeting new enemies: [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)]], [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Black Bolt]] and [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)]]. \n\nWithout the backing of the U.S. government, the Gamma Corps became fugitives and went into hiding, but continued to search for each Illuminati member. Prodigy thought he found Iron Man approaching their base, alerting the group, but the Corps was surprised when [[Green Goblin (Norman Osborn)|Iron Patriot]] arrived. Afraid he was there to arrest them, the group lashed out, unwilling to hear what he had to say. Once Prodigy incapacitated the Patriot, Grey allowed him to speak. He offered the Corps a chance at redemption by becoming his bounty hunters, bringing unregistered superhumans to justice. Eager to regain a purpose, the Gamma Corps readily agreed, but after Osborn was removed from his position as head of superhuman affairs, the fate of the Corps has yet to be revealed.",
