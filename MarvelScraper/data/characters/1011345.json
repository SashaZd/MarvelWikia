Though Spider-Man stopped the \"invasion\", the Tinkerer got away leaving behind only a rubber mask, leaving a confused Spider-Man to ponder just who or what the Tinkerer really was.\n\nYears later, Spider-Man learns that the Tinkerer is an ordinary man who has an extraordinary talent for anything mechanical, and his \"aliens\" were really movie stuntmen in costumes, doing his dirty work.\n\nThe Tinkerer has in recent years been inventing armor and weapons for various super-criminals, including the [[MACH-IV|Beetle]], the [[Big Wheel]], [[Hobgoblin (Jason Macendale)]], and the [[Constrictor]]. \n\nMost recently, Tinkerer was severely injured by [[Punisher (Frank Castle)|Punisher]] amidst the superhero [[Civil War]]. He recovered and went back to his work, but was eventually arrested. His son, [[Agent (Rick Mason)|Rick Mason]] struck a bargain with [[Green Goblin (Norman Osborn)|Norman Osborn]] to have the Tinkerer released upon completion of a single mission. Osborn agreed and kept his word after Mason delivered on his end.",
