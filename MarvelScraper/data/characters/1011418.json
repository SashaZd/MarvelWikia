When the [[X-Men]] went missing during the [[Fall Of The Mutants]] [[Mojo]] created the X-Babies again, this time as their own entities. However, he decided they were a bad idea and was about to have them destroyed when they escaped.\n\nThe X-Babies went to the UK (Earth), however Mojo sent “The Agent” (a brainwashed Ricochet Rita) after them. The X-Babies were aided by [[Shadowcat]] and [[Excalibur]], but had to agree to work for [[Mojo]] so that “The Agent” would be released from her brainwashing.\n\nThe X-Babies gained several new recruits and once again left the Mojoverse, this time looking for help from the [[X-Men]]. Magog and Gog followed the X-Babies and tried to make them return to the Mojoverse.\n\nAfter returning the Mojoverse, the X-Babies tried to save the Pix from the [[Brotherhood Of Mutant Bullies]]. Failing in their mission the X-Babies returned to their base, only to be attacked and captured by Centennials (Parade balloons turned into Sentinels).\n\nThe X-Babies were forced to take part in a game show designed by Funhouse (A Mojo-baby version of [[Arcade]]), and to save the lives of their rivals of the Brotherhood were about to agree to work for [[Mojo]].\n\nHowever before they could agree, Charlie X showed up with reinforcements and saved the X-Babies.\n\nDuring one of their playpen sessions, Psychilde was involved in an accident that caused her cellular structure to decay rapidly. The X-Babies needed to use [[Mojo]]’s machines to save Psychilde. The [[Mighty ‘Vengers]] battled the X-Babies, stopping them getting to the machines. However, the ‘Vengers quickly realised that [[Mojo]] was a bad guy and so helped the X-Babies, resulting in Psychilde getting a new body.",
