She uses this power exceedingly rarely.  Sabra's bracelets shoot paralytic plasma-charged energy quills.

Highly self-motivated, she graduated to the [[Israeli Super Agents]] team, where she was given a flight cloak & experimental bracelets which fired paralysis-inducing plasma darts.  she took the code name Sabra, which described both a native born Israeli and a sweet prickly pear which grows in Israel.\n\nWhen Ruth gave birth to a son, [[Jacob]], she requested an in-country position & became a Tel Aviv policewoman, a position she held for years.  She worked covertly with Super Agents, once saving a near-dead addict by giving the addict wind-control powers; as [[Windstorm]], the ex-addict joined the [[Super Agents]].  Ruth's son died at age 6 when terrorists bombed his school bus, but she continued working as a policewoman until the [[Hulk]] entered Tel Aviv & she resumed her Sabra identity to oppose him.  Sabra was subsequently sent to Washington D.C. to represent Israel when the [[Hulk]] was pardoned, & later unwittingly fought for [[Death]] in the [[Grandmaster]]'s [[\"Contest of Champions\"]], where she was unhappily allied with the [[Arabian Knight]] (Abdul Qamar).  When [[Windstorm]] betrayed the [[Super Agents]], leading the [[\"Israelis for Anarchy\"]] in kidnapping an American ambassador's deaf son, Sabra reclaimed the powers she had given her, leaving [[Windstorm]] near death.  She imbued the ambassador's son with low-level powers to save his life.\n\nThrough a misunderstanding, Sabra battled the [[Hulk]] again when he entered Israel to protect young mutant [[Max Meer]] from [[Achilles]], & Max was left comatose.  She was later assigned to protect the Israeli Prime Minister at a secret peace conference in New York, working alongside Syria's super agent [[Batal]] & the American [[New Warriors]].  Mind-controlled by an undisclosed foe, Sabra attacked the peace mission before the New Warrior's [[Justice]] bought her to her senses; Sabra development a romantic fondness for her rescuer.\n\nWith her government's approval, she began working within Charles Xavier's [[\"Mutant Underground,\"]] & when [[Bastion]]'s anti-mutant [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]] infiltrated Israeli intelligence, Sabra smuggled data to the [[X-Men]]. exposing the infiltration.  She became an unofficial liaison between Israel & the mutant community, exposing [[Magneto]]'s false [[Erik Lehnsherr]] identity, aiding the [[Magneto]] duplicate [[Joseph]], & working with [[Excalibur]].  Her liaison position was made official, & she joined [[X-Corporation]] at their Mumbi, India branch.  She retained close contact with the [[X-Men]] after that facility's destruction, & when [[Bishop]] asked Sabra to join his pro-government super-criminal hunters, her government readily assented after briefly assigning her to aid [[Union Jack]] (Joey Chapman), [[USAgent]] & a new [[Arabian Knight]] (David Hasim) against terrorists in London.",
