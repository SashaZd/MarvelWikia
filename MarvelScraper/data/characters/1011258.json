It turned out that he had injected himself with serums of various animal stem cells, causing him to be engulfed into a large flesh like chrysalis. Carlie ran test on the chrysalis and discovered that it was highly corrosive and destroyed whatever it came into contact with, although when Freak emerged from the chrysalis lost its corrosive abilities and she was able to gather samples. Carlie would later share the samples with Professor Connors.\n\nDuring a bizarre April snowstorm Carlie would become hostage and women sacrifice for the demented Doctor [[Rabin, Benjamin|Benjamin Rabin]], who sought to be given the powers of a Mayan Wayep God-King from [[Wayep|Deity]], but his plan was foiled by Spider-Man.",
