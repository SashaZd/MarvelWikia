        "bio": "Virtually nothing is known about the background of the mercenary who calls himself Paladin. It is not known why he decided to become an adventurer (beyond his obvious swashbuckling bravado) or where he got the special weaponry he uses. In his first recorded exploit, he crossed paths with[[Daredevil]] while both were on the trail of the villainous [[Purple Man]]. \n\nThe Purple Man had manipulated the industrialist [[Glenn, Maxwell|Maxwell Glenn]] into committing criminal acts for which he was being prosecuted, and Daredevil became personally involved, as he was dating Glenn’s daughter, Heather. In contrast, for Paladin, it was just business. He had been hired to take down the Purple Man by one former victims. Paladin and Daredevil crossed paths twice as they worked separately on the case, until on their third encounter they joined forces. The Purple Man eluded them both, however, when he fell into the water around [[Ryker's Island]] Prison and presumably drowned.\n\nPaladin was then hired by a woman named [[Roberts, Marsha|Marsha Roberts]] who wanted protection from her former boyfriend who had been transformed into a radioactive madman calling himself [[Phantasm]]. Similarly, Paladin was hired by [[Michaels, Christine|Christine Michaels]] to track down her husband who had been transformed into Thermo the Thermatronic Man. Thermo was believed to be the so-called Street Stalker who was plaguing Manhattan, and [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] bumped into Paladin when tracking him down. The two fought Thermo outside a nightclub, which alerted [[Dazzler (Allison Blaire)|Dazzler]], and it took the combined efforts of all three heroes to take Thermo down. \n\nHe next appeared at the Caribbean island resort of Utopia Cay on behalf of a consortium of casino owners who hired him to apprehend the criminal [[Baron Brimstone]] who had been robbing their casinos. Ever the womanizer, he bumped into the vacationing [[Wasp|Janet van Dyne]], whose identity as the Wasp is publicly known, and they began seeing each other romantically. Together, they defeated Brimstone and parted amicably. He looked her up again when he was in New York, and wound up helping the Wasp apprehend several of the [[Avengers]]’ foes who were forming [[Baron Zemo (Helmut)|Zemo]]’s [[Masters of Evil]] at the time. The Wasp chided the mercenary that he helped despite the fact he was not being paid for it.\n\nSpider-Man came into conflict with Paladin when the mercenary was hired by [[Silver Sable]] to investigate a conspiracy against her native country of [[Symkaria]]. Spider-Man apologized for his intervention and helped Silver Sable and Paladin uncover an assassination plot. Paladin breezed off to another contract, leaving Spider-Man and Sable to deal with the assassination. \n\nBeing a true gun-for-hire, Paladin has often found himself working on either side of the law. For instance, he was once hired by [[Mangano, Vincent|Vincent Mangano]], godfather of a [[Maggia]] crime family, to kill the [[Punisher (Frank Castle)|Punisher]] (although he claimed to be in it just for the money so that he could retire). Paladin’s first attempt failed, however, and Mangano set up his favored hitman to aid him. The two were still unsuccessful, as the Punisher found an ally in the [[U.S.Agent]], who himself was hired to apprehend the Punisher but switched allegiances when he learned his orders were influenced by Mangano as well.  \n\nPaladin continued to work for Silver Sable, joining her elite version of the [[Wild Pack]], the [[Outlaws]], alongside [[Sandman]], the [[Prowler (Hobie Brown)|Prowler]], and others. One of the Paladin’s first excursions with the Outlaws brought him into conflict with [[Excalibur]], as Silver Sable traced stolen technology from her nation to England. [[Captain Britain (Brian Braddock)|Captain Britain]] and Excalibur were touring the nuclear facility and briefly fought the Outlaws until they uncovered the true culprit, [[Zola, Arnim|Arnim Zola]] and teamed up against the genetic monstrosity behind his experiments.\n\nHe has even been hired by other costumed individuals, in particular the time when [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] sought help in rescuing her allies [[Asp (Cleo Neferteri)|Asp]] and [[Black Mamba]] from the [[Serpent Society]], who had imprisoned the two on charges of treason against the team. Paladin, Diamondback, and [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] succeeded in rescuing the them, but almost immediately afterward, the three women were taken by [[M.O.D.A.M.]] to be a part of [[Superia]]’s army of female supervillains. Paladin and Captain America had to infiltrate a cruise liner full of women to rescue them, an aspect of the assignment that the lady killer, Paladin particularly enjoyed. \n\nAlthough Silver Sable quickly abandoned the Outlaws as a team, Paladin was often hired to work with her as a recurring member of her Wild Pack. \n\nAt least once, Paladin was hired by the [[Hellfire Club]] to lead a group of mercenaries. At the time, [[Cable]] was on the trail of the mysterious [[Tomorrow Agenda]], a program that [[Pierce, Donald|Donald Pierce]] begun to seek out the power of the mutant Apocalypse for his own use. Cable easily dispatched the mercenary team in his search for Pierce, taking out Paladin with ease.\n\nMore recently, Paladin was hired by [[Frost, Adrienne|Adrienne Frost]] to recover a mystic samurai sword from the island nation of [[Madripoor]]. Unfortunately, the job went sour, as the sword was protected by the Rising Sons. Paladin retreated to Frost, who was then co-headmistresses of the Massachusetts Academy, where he encountered the young mutants of Generation X. Frost sent both Paladin and [[Generation X]] after the sword, and [[Jubilee]] became smitten by the flashy Paladin. After a desperate battle, and a near-death experience for Paladin, they managed to retrieve the sword, and Paladin parted company.  \n\nAbout the same time, Frost set herself up as the new White Queen of the New York branch of the world conquering Hellfire Club, and later, with her influence on Paladin, used him to steal billions of dollars from the London chapter. Frost later claimed that, when going into hiding to escape the London Club's retribution, she killed Paladin.",
