Stark's ideological basis for the team's existence was that heroes should respond to crisis situations before they swelled out of control. The Scarlet Witch's hex powers were expected to interface with PLATO's probability programs, predicting crisis points.\n\nUnfortunately, the team's first mission was beyond PLATO's ability to predict - the Starstealth, a group of [[Kree]] warriors, came to Earth alongside a Recorder android, erroneously believing that Wonder Man and the [[Vision]] had destroyed their homeworld, Hala. During a confrontation at the old Avengers West Coast facility, the Kree's powerful Ion Cannon threatened to destroy the Earth. Wonder Man seemingly died ending the threat, and the team's forces were bolstered by the unexpected arrival of amnesiac alien [[Century]]. Century was followed by the [[Scatter]], carnivorous colony insects who laid waste to whole worlds. Force Works drove them away from Earth after a fierce battle in the streets of Houston, Texas.\n\nFlush with early success but still reeling from Wonder Man's death, Force Works embarked on a series of globe-trotting adventures: in the Baltic nation Slorenia, they encountered the mystic champion of an oppressed people, [[Ember (Pavel Chenklo)|Ember]], and the armored warrior [[Black Brigade]]; in Hong Kong, they united with [[Rhodes, James|War Machine]] against the [[Mandarin]]; and in Australia, they discovered a neophyte hero named [[Dreamguard]], assisting him against the enigmatic alien [[Orphan (alien)|Orphan]]. During these missions, the team was secretly hampered by the [[Recorder]], who had remained with them following their initial mission. The Recorder's deceptions were eventually exposed after he aided the [[Starstealth]] in escaping from the metahuman prison known as the [[Vault]].\n\nAfter teaming with the Avengers against the Starstealth and escaping the clutches of an alien merchant named [[Broker (alien)|Broker]], Force Works became embroiled in an elaborate scheme known as the [[Crossing]]. Iron Man, acting under the influence of [[Immortus]] (who was posing as [[Kang|Kang the Conqueror]]), betrayed the team's newest associate, [[Cybermancer|Suzi Endo]], replacing her with an alternate dimensional counterpart of herself who usurped her identity as [[Cybermancer (alternate future)|Cybermancer]]. [[Moonraker]], an alleged Space Phantom masquerading as a dimensionally displaced hero, joined the group, altering memories so that it seemed he had been a member for months and was romantically involved with Spider-Woman. Moonraker successfully sowed confusion and doubt, then led the team to Vietnam, distracting them from Immortus and his true plans. Force Works barely survived these events, working in tandem with the Avengers, but the group was without focus after Iron Man's departure. They remained together long enough to foil an attempt by counterparts of [[Wonder Man (alternate future)|Wonder Man]] and [[Ultron (alternate future)|Ultron]] to rescue the evil Suzi Endo, then most of the members went their separate ways, with the Scarlet Witch returning directly to the Avengers.",
