While her body was in a trance, Layla was able to appear to [[Madrox]], despite their being 80 years apart; how she managed this is unrevealed.

Despite knowing that restoring the conventional Reality-616 would destroy her idyllic new life, Layla unlocked numerous heroes' memories; they confronted the [[Scarlet Witch]], who restored reality to normal but depowered most of Earth's mutants at the same time, an event later dubbed [[\"M-Day.\"]]  \n\nLayla awoke back in the orphanage, seemingly no longer a mutant, but now aware of probable futures & how to promote one over another.  With this foreknowledge, she ran away & approached mutant detective agency [[X-Factor]], concealing her motives, Layla helped them investigate Singularity Investigations & its similarly prescient head, [[Damian Tryp]].  He was recreating the mutant-killing Legacy Virus to prevent a future where repowered mutants destroyed humanity (Earth-6124), but Layla's presence proved a random factor Tryp could not anticipate, & [[X-Factor]] destroyed Singularity Investigations.  \n\nLayla's prescience often unsettled her teammates, especially [[Jamie Madrox [[Multiple Man]], who the 13-year-old Layla claimed was her future husband.  Regarding Scarlet Witch's brother [[Quicksilver]] as dangerous & generally despising him, Layla tried to arrange his death, but failed because he possessed a small portion of his sister's chaos power, making him unpredictable; depowered by [[M-Day]], he had gained new powers from stolen [[Terrigen]] crystals, but he lost these abilities thanks in part to Layla's manipulations.\n\nTryp's silent partner, the [[Isolationist]] (Josef Huber), plotted to slaughter Earth's remaining mutants; aware of Layla, he had [[Nicole]],a robotic simulacrum of a young, depowered mutant, infiltrate [[X-Factor]], its chaotic randomizing generator disrupting  Layla's foresight.  [[Nicole]] tried to murder Layla, but an unhinged [[Quicksilver]] rescued her, claiming he did so in hopes of killing Layla himself.  Escaping him, Layla warned [[X-Factor]] in time to thwart Huber, & lured [[Nicole]] into the path of an oncoming train.\n\nLayla foresaw a terrifying future, where she would need to permit herself to be held in a mutant internment camp for the sake of achieving her overall goals.  The birth of a new mutant, the first since [[M-Day]], triggered hope that it might be possible to restore mutantkind, & [[Madrox]] sent two of his duplicates to gather information from alternate futures where this restoration succeeded.  Layla jumped in on one of the time jumps, ending up 80 years ahead in a world where a mutant/human race war had concluded with mutants in camps (Earth-1191).  Incarcerated, she & the [[Madrox]] duplicate learned that the newborn in their own time had started the war, & Layla slew the duplicate so that his knowledge would be transmitted back to Earth-616.  Though displaced from her own time, Layla soon communicated through the timelines to [[Madrox]] herself, somehow informing him that their teammate [[Siryn]] was pregnant with his child.  Escaping the mutant camp, Layla worked with [[Ruby Summers]] building a rebellion against the anti-mutant regime.  When she was 21, Layla found a means to bring [[Jamie Madrox]] to her from Earth-616, though from his perspective less than a year had passed since Layla had been lost in the future.",
