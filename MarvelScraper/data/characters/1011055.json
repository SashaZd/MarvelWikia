However, Gideon recovered, his nature as a mutant External allowing himself to be resurrected. Although his subsequent history remains largely unrevealed, over the course of the next several hundred years, he became quite wealthy and discovered other [[Externals]] like himself. In more recent years, Gideon studied at Harvard but was expelled under circumstances to be revealed. He went on to build his company, Ophrah Industries, into a corporate giant, intending to use his ever-growing financial power to dominate the world.\n\nGideon first came to public notice when he began forging alliances between high-tech industrial consortiums, such as GeneTech and the Taylor Foundation, and with powerful mutants or secret organizations such as [[A.I.M.]] He is known to have formed an alliance with the [[Toad]], who was leading the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] at the time, in a scheme to recreate the menace [[Proteus]]. Similarly, he joined a group of hedonists known as the [[Upstarts]], although whether or not he carried through with their goals of killing mutants is unknown.\n\nA long-time family friend of the DaCosta family, he erroneously believed the young Roberto DaCosta (secretly the hero [[Sunspot]]) to be the new immortal that the Externals had been looking for. Gideon manipulated events to have DaCosta's father killed and Roberto to take over the role as leader of the DaCostaâ€™s family company. Gideon positioned himself as DaCosta's mentor, taking him away from his role in the team of [[New Mutants]] and into Gideon's confidence.\n\nUntil recently, Gideon kept his power a secret, preferring to work behind the scenes. However, the [[New Warriors]], when investigating criminal links of the Taylor Foundation, caused Gideon to reveal his mutant powers and sadistic temperament. He soundly defeated them.\n\nWhen it was discovered that [[Cannonball (Sam Guthrie)|Cannonball]] was the mutant Gideon was searching for, Gideon abandoned DaCosta, subjecting him to vicious experiments, until he was later rescued by the New Mutant's later incarnation, [[X-Force]].\n\nSurprisingly, Gideon sent a distress call to X-Force after being betrayed by the External [[Selene]]. For reasons of her own, Selene was suddenly killing the remaining members of the Externals, absorbing their life forces. Despite the efforts of X-Force, Gideon was the first External to be killed by Selene, when she drained him of his life energy.",
