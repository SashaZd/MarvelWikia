It was to Venko himself to do the job. Venko was tricked by Iron Man in believing the leader of the Kremlin wanted him Liquored when ever he destroyed his enemy or not. He switched sides and started working at Stark Enterprises. What both of them didn't know was that Stark literally saved Venko's live. \n\nVenko became a valued employee of Stark Enterprises and a good friend of the CEO Tony Stark who warned him not to over exert himself on improving Laser Light technology but remained as deadly to the users as its target.\n\nThe Kremlin didn't take well to turn coats and send [[Crimson Dynamo (Boris Turgenev)|Boris Turgenev]] and [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|the Black Widow]] to retrieve both him and Tony Stark. Boris was successful in subduing Venko and stole his armor pretending to be the good professor. Venko cleared his name by killing the infiltrator but his laser light gun exploded killing both of them at the same moment.\nDying for the country he saw now as a home.\n\nVenko's legacy continued to pester America in the coming years due to the flowwing Crimson Dynamo's, the unicorn and [[Titanium Man (Boris Bullski)|Titanium Man]] that was constructed in its old Siberian lab.",
