Fearing their lack of control could prove fatal, Utrecht funded research into technology to further this control. This technology proved capable of \"curing\" certain powers, which later intrigued Utrecht's friend and associate, rogue CIA agent [[Crossfire|William Cross]].

Seeking recognition and revenge, the U-Foes attempted the Hulk's execution on live television, but the Hulk defeated them with help from the alien [[Bereet]].\n\nThe four accidentally exiled themselves to the [[Crossroads of Reality]] when Vector's escape efforts repelled the U-Foesâ€™ home dimension from them. There, they again met the Hulk, who briefly trapped them in four separate dimensions with the aid of the [[Puffball Collective]], an alien life form. Regrouping, they were returned to Earth by the mutant [[Portal]] (Charles Little Sky) but immediately defeated by the [[Avengers]]. Ironclad, Vapor, and X-Ray were placed in the [[Vault]], but escaped during the so-called \"Acts of Vengeance.\"  Led by [[Loki]] to believe that the Avengers had slain Utrecht, the threesome attacked the [[Avengers Compound]] before learning the truth and fleeing. Vapor briefly joined [[Superia]]'s female army the [[Femizons]], but the foursome reunited to seek Portal's aid in recovering some extra-dimensional artifacts. Interrupted by [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]], [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]], and [[Darkhawk]], the four were returned to prison before being freed by the [[Leader]], for whom they broke into the [[Pantheon]]'s [[Mount]]. Vector was later sighted at the [[Brass Bishop (unrevealed)|Brass Bishop]]'s energy auction of the corpses of [[Silver]] and [[Auric]], and the four were shortly thereafter recaptured. Imprisoned in the Vault, they allied with Crossfire to attempt escape, but project director Rozalyn Backus stole much of Utrecht's wealth (including his power nullification technology) and tricked Utrecht into believing Crossfire had betrayed them, sparking conflicts between the U-Foes and Crossfire's mind-controlling clique. The [[Thunderbolts]] foiled another escape attempt before the [[Master]] freed the U-Foes, using them to contact the evolved White Tiger and then to break into the Vault for him. At the Master's behest they captured the Hulk and several U.N. scientists, using the Controller's discs to drain information from them. The nascent [[Heroes for Hire]] team stopped them, but they escaped and captured [[Cage, Luke|Luke Cage]] for the Master before being betrayed and left comatose by their employer.\n\nImprisoned in the miniaturized \"[[Big House]],\" they were part of that facility's mass escape, but [[She-Hulk]], [[Southpaw]], and [[Pym, Henry|Henry Pym]] recaptured them and they were moved to the [[Raft]]. Escaping the Raft, they fought a running battle with Crossfire's gang while both groups sought the Vault's corrupt former administrator Rozalyn Backus and Vector's lost technology. She claimed to have destroyed Utrecht's power-removing technology, destroying the U-Foes ability to regain their humanity, so Vector vengefully destroyed Backus' charitable projects. The U-Foes remain at large.",
