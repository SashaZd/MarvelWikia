        "bio": "The Burning Galaxy was destroyed through the machinations of [[Surtur]]. The surviving [[Korbinites]] decided to choose a champion who they would follow to their new home. the Korbinite known as Beta Ray Bill was successful and was transformed into a cybernetic being resembling a fierce creature. The Korbinites then amassed their fleet, put themselves into stasis, and followed Beta's ship, [[Skuttlebutt]]. Bill fought legions of demons sent by Surtur.\n\nAs the fleet approached the Milky Way galaxy, it was detected by a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] satellite. [[Fury, Nick|Nick Fury]] asked [[Thor (Thor Odinson)|Thor]] to investigate. Thor was deemed a threat by Skuttlebutt, so Beta fought him. During the battle Thor was separated from his hammer, [[Mjolnir]], and reverted to Donald Blake. Curious, Bill picked up Mjolnir and the hammer deemed him worthy, granting him the power of Thor. Skuttlebutt landed but both were transported to [[Asgard]] by [[Odin]]. Bill said the hammer should remain his as he had won it fairly.\n\nOdin subsequently decreed the two battle in [[Skartheim]] to the death to see who would reclaim the hammer. Bill's Korbinite physiology gave him somewhat of an advantage in the lava-filled realm, and he was able to win. However, he refused to take Thor's life. It is believed that Odin chose this location to further test Bill's worthiness and to teach Thor a lesson. Mjolnir was returned to Thor, with Odin ordering the creation of the hammer [[Stormbreaker]] for Bill to use. Bill continued to protect his people and assist the [[Asgardians]]. He grew particularly close to [[Sif]], who accompanied him to battle Surtur's demons.\n\nAt one point, a mysterious disease seemed to kill the Korbinites, but they were able to be revived. Bill spent time in space as part of the [[Star Masters]], and was called to join his fellow hammer wielders Thor, [[Thunderstrike]], and [[Thor (Dargo Ktor)|Dargo Ktor]] to battle as the [[Thor Corps]]. His body briefly was reconfigured to use cosmic rather than mystical powers through a special synthesis by Odin and the [[Silver Surfer]].\n\nYears later, long after Bill had found a new home for his people, [[Ragnarok]] loomed over Asgard and Bill, drawn by the Asgardian magic in his hammer, returned to fight along side the surviving Asgardians in the final battle, reducing [[Fenris]] to a skeleton on his arrival as punishment for threatening a weakened Thor. He fought ferociously, willing to die alongside the Asgardians in the climactic final battle against Surtur's forces. But Thor sent him back to his people, asking him to keep the memory of Asgard alive and to honor his memory. Very reluctantly, Bill went.\n[[image:betaraybill01.jpg|thumb|left|Beta Ray Bill fighting Stardust|200px]]\nThe Korbinites had settled on a new planet, but were in danger due to an approaching foe. Bill was chastised for spending too much time with the Asgardians. His old rival [[Alpha Ray]] even attempted to sabotage his efforts to prove he was no longer worthy of being the race's guardian. The foe was actually [[Galactus]], Stormbreaker revealing his familiar humanoid form, with a new herald named [[Stardust]]. The planet was lost and some of the fleet was destroyed. Stardust continued to attack Bill as Galactus fed on the planet's energies. During their battle the evil [[Asteroth]] was mistakenly freed from its prison by a portal Stardust opened. Asteroth was defeated, and Bill eventually found himself on [[Earth]]. He has since bonded with a man named Simon Walters. \n\nAfter the [[Civil War]], Bill, in the form of Simon Walters, was compelled by magic forces to travel to Canada. There he found the [[Wrecking Crew]] running riot in a museum. Seeking to protect the innocent bystanders Simon changed into Beta Ray Bill and fought the magically powered thugs. And due to a recent increase in their powers by a magical entity the battle came to a draw between them. However the new [[Omega Flight]] soon came by in order to rescue their teammate [[Sasquatch (Walter Langkowski)|Sasquatch]] who at the time was possessed by the demonic [[Tanaraq]]. During the battle hordes of demons rioted throughout the city causing mass chaos. Once the Wrecking Crew and Sasquatch were secured Beta Ray Bill led the demons back into the portal while fellow Omega Flight member [[Guardian (Michael Pointer)|Guardian]] destroyed the portal behind them, closing it. Beta Ray Bill was then trapped in that other dimension fighting demon hordes.\n\nSomehow, Bill managed to escape from that dimension and was captured by the [[Skrulls]]. As part of their [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] they dissected and tortured Bill to learn more about him and study his genetic material. They also studied Bill's hammer Stormbreaker. Somehow managing to escape, Bill fled to Earth where he landed in Asgard, Oklahoma. Here his friend Thor helped heal Bill back to health. Upon awakening, Bill warned his fellow Asgardians about the looming threat of the Skrulls. The Skrulls then descended upon Asgard as Thor gave Bill his Mjolnir so Donald Blake could help the near-by city. After defeating much of the Skrull forces, a Super-Skrull arrived and beat Bill using his own hammer, which they had altered and used for that Super-Skrull.",
