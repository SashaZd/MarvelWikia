She also allied with the sorcerer Magus, and earned the enmity of the powerful time-spanning sorceress [[Morgan Le Fay]]. Jessica eventually moved to Los Angeles where she worked as a bounty hunter alongside Scotty McDowell before Nick Fury helped her secure private investigator credentials. She lost her immunity power saving Giant-Man ([[Foster, Bill|Bill Foster]]) from radiation poisoning, and a battle with Morgan stranded Jessica on the astral plane until she was rescued by the [[Shroud]], the [[Avengers]] and [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Doctor Strange]]. Later, Jessica and her friend, B-grade actress Lindsay McCabe, moved to Madripoor, where they often teamed with [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]].\n\n\nJessica was drawn to New York when her powers were stolen by [[Doctor Octopus (Otto Octavius)|Doctor Octopus]]' [[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)]]. Following Charlotte's defeat at the hands of [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] (herself a self-styled Spider-Woman), Jessica once more regained her uncanny abilities accepting an offer from Hydra while working as a double agent for Nick Fury. After seventeen months of procedures, she emerged more powerful than ever, now capable of fully flying (rather than just gliding on air currents). After serving with Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Luke Cage as the Avengers formed in the aftermath of M-Day, Jessica left the team after the Superhuman Registration Act divided the heroes. She ultimately decided to ally herself with Captain America's anti-registration team, and was part of the unsanctioned Avengers.\n\nAfter the events of Civil War, the remnants of Captain America's rebellious Avengers formed the New Avengers, aided by Doctor Strange.",
