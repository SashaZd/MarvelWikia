There he met up with and joined the [[Sandman (William Baker)|Sandman]] in order to take over Earth, but the [[Fantastic Four]], with the help of [[Crystal]], beat him and used one of Reed's inventions to shut off his powers, allowing them to return him to the Negative Zone.",

While adventuring in the Negative Zone, the Fantastic Four have since run into Blastaar again on many occasions. Blastaar has also regained the throne of Baluur for himself, and then begun a conquest of the Negative Zone, which has been primarily kept in check by the interference of Blastaar's hated enemy, [[Annihilus]].\n\nRecently Blastaar has been seen in the positive universe in the company of the [[Spaceknights]] of [[Galador]]. Together they secretly fought Annihilus and his insectoid soldiers, which were known as the [[Annihilation|Annihilation Wave]]. Blastaar and the Spaceknights joined [[Nova]] and the [[United Front]] on the [[Kree]] planet of Canticus Prime, where they were able to defeat the forces of Annihilus.\n\nBlastaar later appeared on the Kree Homeworld of Hala, where he led a Kree battalion against the techno-organic invaders known as the [[Phalanx]]. Blastaar fought valiantly but was stomped into the planet by a giant size member of the Phalanx. His fate is unknown at this time.",
