Black Eagle contacted [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] and requested that he help Dani to control her powers. Upset with her grandfather, Dani manifested an image of his greatest fear — his own death — which proved true as the operatives of [[Pierce, Donald|Donald Pierce]] attacked in search of young mutants. Dani joined with several of Pierce's other victims who, under Charles Xavier's guidance, were able to defeat him. Despite reservations, the group ultimately enrolled at the [[Xavier Institute]]. She, [[Wolfsbane]], [[Sunspot]], [[Karma]], and [[Cannonball (Sam Guthrie)|Cannonball]] formed the [[New Mutants]].",
