Franklin eventually settled with her \"Aunt\" Marla Madison, and \"Uncle\" J. Jonah Jameson, both close friends with her father, and frequently varied the appearance of her costume. As Spider-Woman, she battled Flesh and Bones, Shadrac, the Shadowcaster, aliens looking to conquer Earth, the psychic projections of Brian Leighton (creating an amalgam of the [[Rhino]], [[Doctor Octopus (Otto Octavius)| Doctor Octopus]], [[Brock, Eddie|Venom]]), Miss Itch and Mr. Scratch, and a werewolf nun.\n\nMattie's father died, making her living arrangement with the Jamesons more permanent, as they became her foster parents. She was later seduced into a dark world of illegal drugs by boyfriend Denny Haynes, who used Mattie's own flesh as a source for a superhuman power-granting drug called MGH (Mutant Growth Hormone), before being rescued by Jessica Drew and [[Jones, Jessica|Jessica Jones]]. Jessica Drew resumed her role as Spider-Woman, while Mattie retired from superheroics, attending a support group with other young former superheroes.",
