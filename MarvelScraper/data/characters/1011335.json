It has emerged that Maria was chosen as the other candidates were \"Fury Loyalists\" and SHIELD needed \"new direction\".\n\nAt first Hill had her differences with [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]] (Tony Stark) and the New [[Avengers]]. Mainly due to the fact they withheld information on the \"[[House of M]]\" event leading to \"M-Day\". After Hill arrested [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], unmasked him and used SHIELD psychics agents to probe his mind for information regarding the \"House of M\" events, Maria redeemed herself to them by not following the presidents advice and bombing the island of [[Genosha]] to disable a current threat as the Avengers were present at the time.\n\nBefore the \"[[Glossary:S#Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]]\" was passed as law, Hill met with [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)]] aboard the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier|helicarrier]] and proposed that he lead the Avengers within the law and arrest anyone who would not comply. Captain America declined her offer, stating that he would not arrest people who risk their lives for their country every day of the week. Upon his failure to comply Hill ordered her [[Glossary:S#superhuman|superhuman]] response team or \"[[Glossary:C#cape killers|cape killers]]\" to tranquilize Captain America. During the scuffle Rogers avoided being tranquilized and escaped becoming the de facto leader of the [[Secret Avengers]].\n\nAfter the \"Civil War\" had ended Hill stepped down as directer giving the position to Iron Man Tony Stark and has resumed her duties as commander for SHIELD.",
