These same potions greatly slowed his aging process. At the time of his death he was over 70 years old and he appeared to be in his prime, though age was beginning to affect him. His agility, reflexes, stamina, and endurance were also enhanced. As he constantly ingested these potions he usually had these abilities, but without the effects of these potions he still possessed physical strength and agility of the level of an Olympic athlete.",

Unlike other hunters, he typically disdained the use of guns or bow and arrows preferring to take down large dangerous animals with his bare hands even though he often made elaborate preparations to weaken a quarry before hand. He also used a mystical serum to give him similar strength to Spider-Man, but even without the serum he was a threat to the wall-crawler. However, Kraven's continual underestimation of the superhero's resourcefulness made him a frustrating quarry.",

He also used a mystical serum to give him similar strength to Spider-Man, but even without the serum he was a threat to the wall-crawler. However, Kraven's continual underestimation of the superhero's resourcefulness made him a frustrating quarry.\n\nFor a time, he gave up hunting Spider-Man, but his manipulative lover, [[Calypso|Calypso Ezili]], tricked him into believing Spider-Man set his caged animals free. Goading Kraven into resuming his pursuit, both she and Kraven were arrested. Convinced he would never be worthy of Calypso's love until he humbled Spider-Man, Kraven once again hunted Spider-Man. This time, Calypso muted Spider-Man's spider-sense, while the two battled. When Kraven realized Calypso had drugged Spider-Man with a hallucinogenic dart, he stopped the fight out of honor. The police captured the two again.\n\nAfter numerous battles in which Kraven was bested by the Wall Crawler, he finally defeated Spider-Man by shooting him and burying him for what would be his [[Kraven%27s_Last_Hunt|last hunt]]. He then donned Spider-Man's black costume and set out to prove that he was a greater Spider-Man than Spidey himself. He hunted down and defeated the creature known as [[Vermin]] who previously was only able to be defeated after Spider-Man enlisted the help of [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]].\n\nThe still living Spider-Man, who had actually been shot with a tranquilizer dart, clawed his way out from the grave and attacked Kraven but the hunter did not retaliate. Believing that he had regained his honor, Kraven released Vermin onto the streets. Spider-Man pursued Vermin while the deranged Kraven took his own life. \n\nYears later while spiderman was meeting with Al Kravinoff in a villains bar, Kraven reappears greyer but still alive.",
