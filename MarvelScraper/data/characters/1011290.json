During an attack by the Dominant Species, a pack of mutant werewolves seeking revenge on the X-Men from a previous encounter, Gleason was forced to wrestle with his lupine nature, at one point attacking and severely injuring the X-Man [[Havok]] over a trivial dispute. Ultimately, he rejected the Dominant Species' attempts to recruit him and assisted the X-Men in defeating them. Gleason eventually joined the Xavier Institute's Paragons training squad. While his past violent outbursts may have been due to the influence of the Dominant Species, Gleason is to be considered a potential concern until more precise conclusions about his personality can be drawn.",
