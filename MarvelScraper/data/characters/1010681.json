Kincaid does not appear to be aware of the scope of her mutation, nor of its inherent potential, as she continues to consume food and treat her body in the same fashion as she did prior to the manifestation of her abilities.\n\nThe events of [[House of M|\"M-Day\"]] left only 27 of the Xavier Institute's students with their powers, including Kincaid, although she would have preferred to lose them. The depowered students and staff were sent back to their homes; however, their bus was bombed by anti-mutant religious zealot [[Stryker, William|Reverend William Stryker]].  Kincaid's former teammate and friend [[Tag]] was among those killed. All of the remaining students were placed by [[Frost, Emma|Emma Frost]] into an all-out brawl, and the ones deemed to be the best were assigned to become a group of trainee [[X-Men]]. Kincaid was among those students who made the grade.\n\n<!-- More context needed here -->After the death of [[Icarus (Jay Guthrie)|Icarus]], the New X-Men thought it would be best to destroy [[Nimrod (Sentinel)|Nimrod]] once and for all. During the battle, [[X-23]] was forced to cut a piece of Kincaid's hand to separate her from Nimrod, but she regenerated it. The team successfully defeated the robot through their group effort and Nimrod was sent back in time.\n\nSoon after the team defeated [[Nimrod (Sentinel) Nimrod]], Cessily and [[X-23]] were ambushed by Weapon X soldiers and [[Kimura]]. The battle resulted in the destruction of the local coffee shop and the capture of Cessily. Kincaid soon broke free but was restrained while part of her skin tried to get back to Cessily. She later found out that the Weapon X facilites were trying to use her mercury-like skin for their latest project, Predator X. Three different Predator X's attacked Cessily and ripped her skin off to use as their own. [[Hellion]] and [[X-23]] quickly came to her rescue, they helped the battered and bruised Cessily out of the building, whilst they were attacked by [[Kimura]] and the Weapon X soldiers.Cessily confronts one of the wounded predators, returning the mercury to her body, strengthening her.[[Surge]] and the rest of the New X-Men along with the X-Men came to their rescue. They quickly destroyed the facility along with the help of the [[O*N*E]]. Cessily soon revealed that one of the Predators got away and that she could feel it as it ran away with a part of her.",
