He frequently battled vampires, including the [[Baroness Blood]], who carried on for the Baron and caused the death of Joey's friend Kenneth Crichton.  After being mortally wounded, Kenneth's mother, Lady Jacqueline - once the WWII-era super-speedster known as [[Spitfire]] - regained her youth and powers through a blood transfusion from the original [[Human Torch (Jim Hammond)|Human Torch]].  She and Joey grew close and began a romance, but the difference in their ages and backgrounds was too much to overcome and they broke up.  However, they remain friends and allies.\n\nCurrently, Union Jack works alone, though he makes himself available to the British Secret Service agency MI5 when needed, and is always willing to help friends and allies like Captain America.",
