The Fallen One was imprisoned many times over many centuries, upon each escape he immediately targeted Galactus, who always defeated him. Eventually the Fallen One was brought down by the [[Star-Lord (Peter Quill)|Star-Lord]]. However, the energy required caused massive collateral damage, leaving 350,000 dead. The Fallen One was kept in a créche in the [[Kyln]]'s Omega Core, a massive intergalactic maximum security prison.",

The Fallen One was kept in a créche in the [[Kyln]]'s Omega Core, a massive intergalactic maximum security prison.\n\nDuring a battle between the [[Maker]] and [[Thanos]] of [[Titan (Moon of Saturn)|Titan]] on the prison planet of Kyln, the power was shut down to many portions of the Kyln. Without power flowing into his containment unit, the Fallen One escaped the Kyln and again sought vengeance on Galactus. As the Fallen One confronted Galactus, Thanos mentally tried to reason with him, reminding him of Galactus' special purpose in the universe. The Fallen One justified himself, saying that Galactus knew his true nature when he made him into what he had become, and still he was casted out. Galactus decides to simultaneously alleviate his own problems and spite Thanos, [[Glossary:T#teleport|teleporting]] the Fallen One to Thanos' ship. The Fallen One's powerful energy attack devastated Thanos' giant ship, sending him plummeting to the surface of the planet below. Surviving unscathed, Thanos and his new ally [[Skreet]] overpowered the Fallen One, sending him into the core of the gas giant and ignited it. Thanos mentally enslaved the Fallen One's unconscious form, so that when he awoke he would serve as Thanos' own herald, as well as provide him with information as to a source of unlimited energy.\n\nWhen the [[Annihilation]] Wave struck and the Kyln was destroyed, Thanos dispatched the Fallen One to investigate the status of the Maker. The Fallen One was captured and drained of his energy by [[Tenebrous]] and [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]], two ancient enemies of Galactus who hoped to use him to find their opponent.",
