A few years after this, the [[Fantastic Four]]'s debut heralded a wave of overt superhuman activity, but the Pride, for the most part, avoided confrontations with Californian super heroes.\n\n\nThe Deans worked to give Karolina a normal childhood untouched by Hollywood scandal; when she was four, they gave her a bracelet which secretly suppressed her alien abilities. Neither Karolina nor the Pride's other children - [[Talkback|Chase Stein]], [[Wilder, Alex|Alex Wilder]], [[Arsenic (and Old Lace)|Gertrude Yorkes]], [[Sister Grimm|Nico Minoru]], and [[Bruiser (Molly Hayes)|Molly Hayes]] - suspected their parents' activities. In recent years, the Deans conspired with the mutant Hayeses to betray the Pride, hoping only they and their daughters would receive immortality. A year and a half later, when Karolina was sixteen, she and her friends discovered their parents' latest murder; Alex Wilder, having learned of both the Pride and the planned coup a year before, manipulated his friends into searching their homes to acquire weapons. During their investigation, Karolina discovered her alien heritage, and most of her friends also developed powers or discovered advanced technology. The six runaways resolved to become heroes, most of them using codenames; however, when they attempted to stop the Pride from offering the Gibborim their latest soul, Alex betrayed them to protect his parents from the Dean/Hayes coup. The Gibborim slew Alex and destroyed the ritual site; the other Runaways escaped. \n\nFor months Karolina struggled with her identity, being both an alien and a lesbian. She fell in love with her best friend, Nico Minoru, only to suffer a rejection. This was timed with the arrival of [[Xavin]], a young [[Skrulls|Skrull]] prince who had been betrothed to Karolina by her parents without her knowledge. Karolina discovered that her parents had been exiled from their homeworld, Majesdane, for inciting a war with the Skrulls. Xavin wanted Karolina to join him in hopes that their marriage could bring peace, but she initially declined his proposal because of her sexual orientation. She agreed after Xavin used his shape-changing abilities to become a woman. Curious about her homeworld and hoping to end the ongoing war, Karolina reluctantly left the Runaways for space.\n\nKarolina fell in love with Xavin, and for a time the two were able to arrange a cease-fire between their races. Though the wedding plans went smoothly, an attack during the actual ceremony forced the couple to flee to Earth, and Karolina and Xavin have re-joined the Runaways. \n\nHer Name is based on the Beatles song \"Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds.\"",
