The group attempted to storm the mansion headquarters of the [[Avengers]] when the team was away on a mission. Unknown to the villains, this feat was made easier due to the fact that many of Earth’s super-powered individuals were being [[Infinity War|replaced by monstrous doppelgangers of themselves]]. The Masters of Evil were thwarted by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] who were visiting the mansion, but both teams were forced to band together to fight their doppelgangers. After defeating them all, Doctor Octopus hoped to continue the battle against the Guardians, but Puff Adder and the others refused to turn on the heroes who had helped them survive and disbanded after forcing Doctor Octopus to flee.\n\nPuff Adder apparently had romantic designs on his teammate [[Princess Python]], although the details of their relationship are not fully known. When Princess Python’s friend set up a date for her with her brother, Jack Truman, Puff Adder intervened out of jealousy. Truman revealed himself to be [[Deathlok (Jack Truman)|Deathlok]], and the two scuffled briefly until Python put a stop to it.",
