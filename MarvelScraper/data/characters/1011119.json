During [[Deadpool (Wade Wilson)|Deadpool]]'s assault on HYDRA to rescue the captured [[Agent X]], he ran into Bob and coerced him into helping him. Bob was hesitant, as HYDRA would not allow him back into the organization having betrayed them, but the (currently four-inch tall) Deadpool tortured him with a security card until he relented.

He then forced Bob to fly them to safety in one of HYDRA's jets, though Bob did not know how to pilot an aircraft.\n\nAfter Deadpool, Agent X, and Bob returned to the United States, they found [[Outlaw (Inez Temple)|Outlaw]] and [[Brandenberg, Sandi|Sandi]] missing. Bob accompanied Deadpool on his mission to save the girls and subsequently became an honorary member of [[Agency X]]. He continues to work with the group on their various missions, and is referred to as Deadpool's \"Pet\" (or \"Minion\", because that is \"more PC\"). Bob was recently shot in the leg, during a raid on the very same HYDRA base Deadpool kidnapped him from, in an attempt to save [[Weasel]] from [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]]. When Wolverine cut off Deadpool's head, Bob was the one who put it back and let Deadpool's healing factor kick in. After Deadpool and Bob rescued Weasel, they were suddenly teleported into the past, where they aided [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] and [[Captain America (James Barnes)|Bucky]] in stopping [[Zola, Arnim|Arnim Zola]]. They eventually ended up in the [[Baxter Building]] 8 years in the past with the [[Fantastic Four]] of that era. The then-current FF (With [[Black Panther (T'Challa)|Black Panther]] and [[Storm]] replacing Reed and Sue) brought them back with the aid of Weasel. Following that adventure, Bob accompanied Deadpool on a mission through various dimensions to help [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Doctor Strange]] save reality after it was damaged by [[T-Ray]]'s novice magic.\n\nHe also traveled with Deadpool and Weasel to the [[Savage Land]], where he ran away from an assortment of dinosaurs. Deadpool attempted to teleport the dinos to [[Genosha]] as a prank on [[Magneto (Max Eisenhardt)|Magneto]], but instead they were sent to the Genoshan Embassy in downtown Manhattan, as well infected with the alien [[Symbiotes]] responsible for [[Brock, Eddie|Venom]] and [[Carnage]]. During the resultant battle, Bob's attempt to flee accidentally caused the death of one of the creatures while a news crew watched. Thinking his actions were intentional, they interviewed Bob who claimed the 'H' on his uniform stood for \"Hero\". He then received a text message from Allison who had seen the events on the news and thought it was hot. Bob is seen watching television with Deadpool and his supporting cast as the series ends.\n\nLater on Bob is seen, in a reversal of roles, he saved Deadpool during a fight with [[Tiger Shark]]. When Deadpool asked him, what he was doing? Bob replied \"U-uh saving you\". Deadpool commanded Bob to throw him the rifle. Bob complied but the rifle fell into the water where Tiger Shark was patiently waiting, Deadpool teased Bob for throwing like a girl. Tiger Shark was eventually defeated and Bob later accompanied Deadpool and [[Swanson, Betty|Doctor Betty Swanson]] on their mission to find a bio-weapon, which turned out to be the Zombified decapitated head of [[Deadpool (Earth-2149)|Deadpool]] from an alternate reality known as the [[Marvel Zombies (Earth-2149)|Zombieverse]].",
