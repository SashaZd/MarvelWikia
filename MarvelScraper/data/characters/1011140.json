On [[Daedalus 5]], a system on the periphery of the [[Kree|Kree Empire]], Annihilus finally employed the Centurions led by Hybelea, as a united strike team. Despite opposing forces that included the likes of [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] (Richard Rider), [[Gamora]], [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], the [[Super Skrull]] and two former Heralds of [[Galactus]], the Centurions assault broke the back of the resisting forces, effectively ending the military phase of the war.",
