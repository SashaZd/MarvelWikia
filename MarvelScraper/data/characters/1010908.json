Beast took on the role of the team's elite engineer, upgrading the X-Men's Blackbird X-Jet and Danger Room sequences.

After rogue telepath David Xavier claimed his father Charles had made Storm fall for Beast in order to keep Hank in the school, Beast shut Storm out, fearing it was true; he increasingly confided in Naomi, eventually revealing Magneto’s survival. \n\nThe Brotherhood ambushed Beast, beating him until he disclosed Magneto’s location. With Magneto’s return, the X-Men became fugitives, hunted by the authorities, battling [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Ultimate)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the [[Ultimates (Ultimate)|Ultimates]]; they finally redeemed themselves by recapturing Magneto and preventing him from destroying Florida. With the X-Men  recognized as heroes, Hank was shocked to find his parents now accepted him, though he realized they merely wished to cash in on his newfound fame. Renewing his relationship with Storm, Beast continued to be active on the Internet, carelessly discussing the X-Men’s angelic new recruit [[Angel (Ultimate)|Warren Worthington]] on his fan website. When religious demonstrations ensued, Hank’s teammates berated him for his foolishness. Feeling insecure again, and aware of the handsome Warren’s attraction to Storm, Beast quit the X-Men after he was approached for [[Frost, Emma (Ultimate)|Emma Frost]]’s new mutant spokesperson program. At the group’s public unveiling, a rogue government faction released a Sentinel; while trying to get others to safety, Beast was struck by debris and killed. He was buried in the Xavier Mansion grounds in a private ceremony; his parents did not bother to attend. \n\nHowever, it has recently been revealed that Beast did not die in the attack.  Shortly afterward, in the hospital, doctors were able to revive him.  But before the X-Men were notified, [[Fury, Nick (Ultimate)|Nick Fury]] and [[Professor X (Ultimate)|Professor X]] stepped in and transported him to the Triskelion, where he was to work on finding a cure to the Legacy Virus.  Professor X psychically convinced Hank that the X-Men knew he was alive and well, though they in fact believed him dead.  After the Professor’s apparent “death,” Beast learned the truth, and became upset at Nick Fury for lying to him.  However, he continued residing in the Triskelion, still presumed dead, researching and experimenting.  One of these experiments resulted in Beast’s skin to return to its normal pigment, instead of blue.\n\nHe later rescued [[Pyro (Ultimate)|Pyro]], and shocked his former teammates by revealing that he was still alive. After being proved to be the real Beast by [[Psylocke (Ultimate)|Psylocke]] and [[Wolverine (Ultimate)|Wolverine]], he was allowed to join [[Bishop (Ultimate)|Bishop's]] new X-Men and continued his relationship with Storm. After Bishop's death, Xavier was revealed to be alive and Beast returned to his life at the Xavier Institute. Although, during Magneto's flooding of New York, Hank was pushed by the water into a store and has gone missing.",
