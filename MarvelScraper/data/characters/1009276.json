In actuality, his brain was creating new neuro-pathways so that he could possess the superhuman ability to telepathically control his tentacles at will. Originally, at his earliest stages, it was thought he could only control his tentacles while they were attached to him. However, when he became separated from his tentacles, he proved he was able to telepathically control them, even if they were a considerable distance. Over long periods of time, he mentally increased the range to which he was able to control them, recorded at over 900 miles in diameter.",

        "weapons": "Tentacles: Doctor Octopus' superhuman abilities derive from the four mentally-controlled, electronically-powered, telescoping, prehensile titanium-steel tentacles attached to a stainless steel harness encircling his body from lower chest to waist. Each tentacle, approximately five inches in diameter, terminates in three single-jointed pincers. The pincers are able to rotate in relation to the arm for 360 degrees, in a screwdriver-like twisting motion. Each tentacle segment contains four high-efficiency electric motors equipped with a clutched, helical-gear train, independently mounted on frictionless gimbals and housed in four thin, overlapping layers of titanium-niobium steel. The titanium-steel alloy is light, has high-tensile strength, a high melting point, and high thin-wall rigidity. The motors get their power from a small nuclear-powered thermo-electric generator, which can provide several hundred watts per hour for up to five years before needing to replace its U-239 core. The tentacles have been modified since the time of the original accident to include high-efficiency battery packs (enabling movement when cut off from the central power source) and individual micro-circuit control modules (enabling each arm to perform certain pre-programmed actions when Octopus loses conscious control). In the event that Octopus loses consciousness, the control module of each arm has enough pre-programmed conditional responses in its memory chip to enable it to perform a relatively complex sequence of actions, such as saving his life. The trauma of his arm or arms being separated from the harness causes a period of disorientation in which his arms flail about uncontrollably until the pre-programming takes over. <br>",

He became the youngest person to serve on the National Board of Nuclear Science. He designed a set of highly advanced mechanical arms to assist him with his research into atomic physics. The tentacled arms were resistant to radiation and were capable of great strength and highly precise movement. They were attached to a harness that fit around his body.\n\nDuring an accidental radiation leak that ended in an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Octavius' body. It was later revealed that the radiation (or possibly his own latent mutation) had mutated his brain so that he could control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from a great distance. The accident also seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was in fact his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs), and the scientist turned to a life of crime.\n\nThough Doctor Octopus himself tends to be portly, and in poor physical shape, he has recently been able to improve upon his physique. He was also near-sighted to the extent that he was legally blind without the aid of his extremely thick eyeglasses, but he no longer appears to suffer from that problem, presumably through the use of laser surgery. With his harness attached he is physically far more than a match for Spider-Man; in his first appearance he beat [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] so badly that the wall-crawler considered giving up his heroic career until he was inspired to continue by the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] at the time when the [[Fantastic Four]] was called in to fight Doctor Octopus.\n\nOver the years, Dr. Octopus has become one of most recognizable members of Spider-Man's rogues' gallery. He remains one of Spider-Man's most dangerous foes, having many legendary battles with him over the years. His crowning achievement was the near-fatal stabbing of Spider-Man's then-partner/lover, the [[Black Cat]], who was placed in critical condition. This led to Spider-Man beating Dr. Octopus within an inch of his life. The trauma of the beating he received from Spider-Man left Octavius severely  phobic of Spider-Man and spiders in general for years. This lasted until Spider-Man was forced to let his nemesis beat him in combat so as to allow him to break free of his fears and recruit him to save New York City from an exploding nuclear reactor.\n\nDoctor Octopus has worked with other supervillains on several occasions, most notably as the leader of the original incarnation of the [[Sinister Six]]. He has been a member of several versions of the team, and founded his own short-lived version of the [[Masters of Evil]] when his teammates from the Sinister Six proved too difficult to manipulate. Certain members of the Six have since attempted to murder him, to no avail.\n\nAt one point, a boy named [[Steel Spider (Ollie Osnick)|Ollie Osnick]] ran away from home, having stolen his father's Octopus-like equipment. He intended to become Doctor Octopus' sidekick, which was to be very much ill-fated. After a brief skirmish with Spider-Man, Osnick was returned home, sans tentacles.\n\n[[image:Octoinline.jpg|left|thumb|240px]]Doctor Octopus was murdered by the insane Peter Parker clone named [[Kaine]]. Octavius's student [[Doctor Octopus (Carolyn Trainer)|Carolyn Trainer]] took over the identity of Doctor Octopus until Octavius was resurrected by a branch of the mystical ninja cult known as the [[Hand]]. Although Octavius had discovered Peter Parker's dual identity shortly prior to his death while curing Parker of a lethal virus created by the [[Vulture (Adrian Toomes)|Vulture]], he lost all knowledge of it upon his resurrection. The reason for this was the memories he regained came from a those recorded on a computer chip provided by his associate Trainer. That recent memory had not been recorded at the time of his death. It is as yet uncertain whether or not Trainer had some ulterior motive for remodeling Octavius's mind.\n\nAfter his resurrection, Octavius attempted to create his own personal assassin in the form of a villainous mutated entity he dubbed \"[[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)|Spider-Woman]]\", and was involved in a plot involving using prosthetic limbs as mind-control devices, to create an army of minions. He also had to contend with a usurper, an arrogant, yet brilliant scientist named [[Carlyle]]. Envious of Octavius's power, Carlyle created his own version of Octavius's harness and then tried to kill him. At the moment, none of the other people who assumed the mantle of Dr. Octopus are currently active, either due to retirement, imprisonment, or, in Ollie Osnick's case, a decision to emulate Spider-Man instead.\n\nMost recently, Octavius resurfaced in the attempt to kidnap a Palestinian ambassador, in hopes of causing chaos for reasons unknown. His plot was thwarted by Spider-Man and his temporary sidekick the [[Kiwi Kid]]. Octavius is currently doing time in a penitentiary.\n\n----\n\nCheck out others who have used the name \"Doctor Octopus\" at the [[Doctor Octopus (disambiguation)|Disambiguation Page]].",
