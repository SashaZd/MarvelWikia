        "bio": "Rutherford Princeton began his life of crimefighting as a police officer in Canada. During Prohibition, he was loaned out to the Chicago force. At some point, his lover, Amelia Weatherly, disappeared, and he believed her to be dead, erecting a gravestone for her. Easing into civilian life, the former policeman and army officer lived many years before slipping into a coma roughly twenty years ago. In need of superhumans, [[Sasquatch (Walter Langkowski)|Sasquatch]] became aware of Princeton's latent mutant powers, and managed to revive the 96 year-old. The now-elderly Princeton initially declined Sasquatch's offer to join [[Alpha Flight]], but eventually accepted. The newly-formed group helped rescue the original Alpha Flight, fought [[Big Hero 6]] and alter stopped the machinations of the criminal [[Manimator]]. During his last known adventure with the team, Princeton was sent back in time, where his teammate [[Nemesis (Amelia Weatherly)|Nemesis]] revealed to him that she was Amelia, his long-lost love. Their post-Alpha Flight adventures have yet to be revealed, though a vision showed Centennial and Nemesis as having died and been buried side by side.",
