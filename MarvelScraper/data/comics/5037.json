    "description": "FOUR FANTASTIC TALES OF THE FF!\r<br>• When a doomsday weapon manufactured by Hydra turns up in the Nevada desert, there’s only one man the authorities can ask to go in and defuse it: Bruce Banner! What does all of this have to do with the FF, you ask? Well, who do you think has to deal with the fallout when it all goes terribly wrong?\r<br>• It’s hard to believe Reed and Sue tied the knot 40 years ago... and it certainly doesn’t seem that much time has passed to Reed and Sue themselves when a special evening out gives them a chance to look over their entire life together— past, present and future! \r<br>• The Invisible Woman is dead! As Reed cradles his murdered wife, lost in grief, and Ben rampages after Sue’s killer, Johnny defiantly decides to do whatever it takes— no matter the cost or consequence— to see his sister alive again. What he does will change the way the Fantastic Four look at him forever.\r<br>• It’s a day of celebration and reflection in Latveria, but deep within the confines of the Latverain Embassy to America, Victor Von Doom and Reed Richards engage in a subtle battle of wits, with all of Manhattan as the playing field. What are the stakes? And can Mister Fantastic triumph when all the moves have been made in advance?\r<br>Collects FANTASTIC FOUR #533-535, FANTASTIC FOUR: THE WEDDING SPECIAL, FANTASTIC FOUR SPECIAL 2005 and FANTASTIC FOUR: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY.\r<br>152 PGS./Rated A ...$16.99\r<br>",
