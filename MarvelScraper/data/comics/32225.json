    "description": "The first year of Deadpool MAX comes to a shocking end! Bob disbanded Hydra after winning back Deadpool, the Taskmaster has kept it going and turned it into a dangerous domestic terrorist organization. Now they've teamed with the Crescent Moon Knights and possibly factions within the U.S. government to release a stockpile of recently acquired Liquid X on an unsuspecting U.S. city.  Can Deadpool and Agent Bob stop them in time or is Bob once again playing into the hands of his puppet masters?   The first year of Deadpool MAX comes to a shocking end in a tale we'd like to call \"A Shocking End!\" or \"I, Patsy\" but in the end went with \"Long Live Hydra!\" Logan",
