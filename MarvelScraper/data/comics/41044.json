    "description": "Two Lokis, three Thors — no Asgard!? Enemies become allies, comrades become strangers, and gods become mortals in Thor's final pre-Onslaught saga! The World Tree Yggdrasil has been tricked into believing that Asgard no longer deserves its place in the multiverse, but the Thunder God will carve one himself if he has to — no matter what magic, or lack thereof, stands in his way! It's a saga spanning from the sewers to the heavens — with Frost Giants, Trolls, gangsters, robots, frogs and more! Plus: a re-telling of Thor's origin like none before or since! Guest-starring Dr. Strange and the Avengers! Collecting THOR (1966) #495 and #497-502.\n",
