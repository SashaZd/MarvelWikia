    "description": "The tension-torn adventures of comics’ most put-upon super hero, the Amazing Spider-Man, continue in another round of Marvel Masterworks classics! Stan Lee kicks it off with one of his craziest creations of all time, the Gibbon. And when that bestial baddy teams up with the vengeful Kraven the Hunter—well, it’s enough excitement to give a hero an ulcer—and it does! Then, words between Peter’s lovely gal Gwen and Aunt May push his doting aunt out of his life and into the arms of—an octopus! Doc Ock returns to do in Spidey, but with Hammerhead, the only gangster with more steel in his dome than in his gun, waging a turf war to take over the city it’s open season on spiders! Always a man of the people, Spidey uncovers the machinations of a mayoral candidate who’s not quite what he seems. Let’s just say there’s no doubt Richard Raleigh put the “action” in political action, alright? And topping it off comes a knuckle-busting, knock-down, drag-out fight between Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk that’s one for the ages! Collecting AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #110-120.\r\nAll Ages …$54.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4215-7",
