    "description": "A tragic accident took his sight — but in return, enhanced Matt Murdock’s remaining senses far beyond human limits. An accomplished attorney by day, by night Murdock seeks justice outside the law as Daredevil, the Man Without Fear. When Marvel Knights took hold of this classic Marvel Comics character 10 years ago, the fledgling imprint redefined Daredevil for a new generation. In famed filmmaker Kevin Smith’s series debut, a scared teenager on the run places her baby in Matt Murdock’s hands. She claims her infant is humanity’s newborn savior, a true miracle child. Yet an elderly stranger soon confronts Murdock with some shockingly different news about this infant. While Daredevil attempts to separate fact from fiction, the deadly assassin Bullseye enters the fray, determined to capture the baby and leave the hero dead in the process. Fans and critics alike rated Smith’s eight-part saga as one of Daredevil’s greatest storylines ever — a tale of surprising twists and turns that leaves the Man Without Fear facing the tragic loss of one of his closest friends. Collecting DAREDEVIL #1-8.\r<br>Rated T+ …$24.99 \r<br>ISBN: 978-0-7851-3439-8\r<br>",
