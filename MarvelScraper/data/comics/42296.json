And if that weren’t enough, an unknown force seems to want her &emdash; dead! Between the tribal loyalties of the schoolyard and the brutal, fight-or-die logic of the mage-war, Kim must steer a course that will keep her alive until she can take the fight back to her enemy and reveal the true identity of someone she thought she already knew: herself.
