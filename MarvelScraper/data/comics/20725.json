    "description": "The Atlas Era Hero Revival continues with the adventures of the comics’ most famous trio of Communist conquering heroes: Captain America, the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner!  Beginning with the Big Three’s anthology adventures in Men’s Adventures, we then dive headlong into Captain America’s complete 1954 solo series. Illustrated by Bullpen legend John Romita in some of his very first super hero stories, you’ll see Cap and Bucky fight Fifth Columnists, Commie spies and even the Soviet Electro!  Next up, it’s the Human Torch and Toro! Returned from his slumber by an atomic bomb, the Torch has rejoined his young sidekick in a battle to clean up threats as amazing and entertaining as vampires, killer robots and his 1950s nemesis, the Vulture. Their crime-fighting adventures even take on a global purchase, stretching all the way to the 38th Parallel and Communist Korea!  And finally, for a quick taste of what’s to come in Atlas Era Heroes’ next volume, comes an assortment of Bill Everett’s lavishly drawn tales of the lord of the Atlantis, Namor the Sub-Mariner. Considered by many to be the definitive take on the character, Everett’s ’50s Sub-Mariner is nothing less than treasure from the deep!  We’d be remiss to leave you without a bevy of historical bonuses, including a rare Human Torch tale that went unprinted for more than a decade, original artwork, Atlas Era house ads and an introduction by Hero Revival scholar extraordinaire Roy Thomas.  Collecting MEN’S ADVENTURES #27-28, CAPTAIN AMERICA #76-78, HUMAN TORCH #36-38 and MARVEL SUPER-HEROES #16.\r<br>All Ages …$59.99 \r<br>",
