    "description": "STRAIGHT OUT OF THE PAGES OF X-MEN AND RIGHT INTO THE JUGULAR! Jubilee is about as far away from the ideal X-Man as it's possible for a 17-year-old minty fresh vampire to be. While the X-Men try to find a way to give her as normal a life as is inhumanly feasible, her decidedly abnormal vampire cravings will not be denied. Between that and her newfound powers, she's winning the fights — but not the popularity contests among most of the other X-Kids. Most, but not all. And just when Jubilee starts to think that there's no place for her anywhere, a group of vampire women make her an offer she can't refuse. It seems like the perfect solution, unless Wolverine has anything to say about it! Collecting WOLVERINE AND JUBILEE #1-4 and Jubilee's first appearance from 1989's UNCANNY X-MEN #244.",
