Fury has assembled three teams of shock troops: the Black, led by former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Alexander Pierce, tasked with destroying Hydra; the White, Daisy Johnson's Secret Warriors, under his direct command; and the Grey, led by his son Mikel, dedicated to taking out Leviathan. But there's another team ready to report for duty, and it's a collection of soldiers from an age of unmatched heroism: the Howling Commandos! Assembled for a reunion with Captain America at their side, the Howlers remember their fallen comrades and plan for their next big battle ‚Äî a fight that will get them in all kinds of trouble with the world‚Äôs governing elite. But what else is new for Nick Fury? Collecting SECRET WARRIORS #17-19 and SIEGE: SECRET WARRIORS.\n",
