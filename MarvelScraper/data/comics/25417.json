    "description": "Escape from the Eighth City...escape from Hell! K’un-Lun is the majestic city of otherworldly kung-fu champions, the spiritual home of the Iron Fist and a repository of centuries-old wisdom. But for many of those centuries, K’un-Lun’s leaders have used the Eighth City — a secret plane with only one way in and no way out — as a dumping ground...to offload their murderers, monsters and demons. But as Danny Rand has just learned, it has also been the prison of K’un-Lun’s political prisoners. And this is a historical shame that cannot stand. The current regime of K’un-Lun has sent Rand and his band of immortal fighters from the Seven Cities to recover the political prisoners — including perhaps the very first Iron Fist — but it is a death mission for which there may be no return...or salvation! Collecting IMMORTAL IRON FIST #22-27.\r\nRated T  …$14.99",
