And the death of Captain America is only the beginning! In the aftermath of the fabled hero’s assassination, Agent 13, Bucky Barnes, the Falcon, Black Widow and Iron Man come together again in a desperate attempt to keep his dream alive. But the collapse of Steve Rogers’ dream was merely the first step in the wicked machinations of the Red Skull, who is determined to see the death of America follow soon after the death of the Captain. As the Skull's master plan kicks into motion, and chaos begins to take hold of the United States, only one man stands in its way – but is he up to the task? Freed from the psychosis that transformed him into the relentless mercenary known as the Winter Soldier, Bucky Barnes is called on to live up to the dream in ways he never imagined.
