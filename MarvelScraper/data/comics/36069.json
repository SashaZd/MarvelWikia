    "description": "The king is dead...long live the king! He is the Norse God of Thunder — master of the storm and lightning, heir to the throne of immortal Asgard. And in the wake of Odin's heroic sacrifice, Thor is called upon to fulfill his father's legacy as lord and master of the Eternal Realm — leaving Earth's protection in the hands of the untested Tarene! But an old foe of the Thunder God has embarked on a quest for immortality, one that may spell the end of both Midgard's fledgling guardian and Thor's new reign! And from beyond the stars comes an even more formidable foe, one whose sights are set on dethroning Asgard's new liege and wiping the Norse Gods from the pages of history. It's Thor, Lord of Asgard vs. Desak, Destroyer of Pantheons! In the aftermath, the first steps in a startling change for the once-Thunder God will have ramifications for the entire Marvel Universe! Collecting THOR (1998) #44-50.",
