    "description": "A freak thunderstorm hit the wide open spaces of Oklahoma…the same day a young doctor named Donald Blake drove into town! Now the friendly residents of this cozy burg are just as puzzled by the walking stick-carrying young man as they are by the storm clouds gathering on the horizon. Little do they know an honest-to-goodness god of Asgard walks among them, searching for his own home in the heart of theirs…and he’s got big plans for their dusty little town!  But what connection does Asgard–and Norse mythology have to the wide-open plains of Oklahoma?",
