Hot off the success of the FANTASTIC FOUR, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby’s atomic update on the Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde tale, mixed the joy of giant monsters with Cold War intrigue and added a heavy dose of psychological drama to create a formula that even decades later has readers clamoring for more. So for each and every purple pants loving Hulkophile, the MARVEL MASTERWORKS are proud to present the Hulk’s original six-issue solo series in one amazingly restored volume.
