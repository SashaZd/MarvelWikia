In ULTIMATE FANTASTIC FOUR ANNUAL #1, it’s the first appearance of the Ultimate Inhumans! From a hidden race, she came to steal the heart of the FF’s youngest member: the beautiful elemental called Crystal! In ULTIMATE X-MEN ANNUAL #1, Juggernaut makes a play for the Gem of Cyttorak, the jewel that will make him truly unstoppable. Only two small things stand in his way: Rogue and Gambit, the new prince and princess of thieves! In ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN ANNUAL #1, Spidey goes toe-to-toe with some old foes – and winds up with a new girlfriend! Who is she? Let’s just say she has a familiar face. And in THE ULTIMATES ANNUAL #1, if you thought the Ultimates were the only team S.H.I.E.L.D. was creating — you were wrong! Get ready for the next wave of super-soldiers designed to protect America’s vital interests. But is this all Director Nick Fury is up to, or is there much more to this ultra-clandestine program? And can even S.H.I.E.L.D. keep all these super-people under control?
