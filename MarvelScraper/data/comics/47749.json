    "description": "The techno-organic nightmare known as the Phalanx has risen! Powerful anti-mutant bigots have created the ultimate weapon from the ashes of the deceased alien Warlock: a cold, vicious and unstoppable foe that absorbs all in its path. But these Phalanx are far more than their creators bargained for — and they plan to summon their parent race to overtake Earth! When the Phalanx take out the X-Men, the remaining members must split into three teams: to save young mutants from the Phalanx’s clutches, to prevent their foes from contacting their homeworld and to rescue the X-Men! But even with the aid of the rogue Phalanx unit Douglock, can these ragtag groups succeed? Collecting UNCANNY X-MEN (1963) #306, #311-314 and #316-317; EXCALIBUR (1988) #78-82; X-MEN (1991) #36-37; X-FACTOR (1986) #106; X-FORCE (1991) #38; WOLVERINE (1988) #85; and CABLE (1993) #16.",
