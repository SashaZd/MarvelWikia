    "description": "The mountain giants are on the march! Surtur has broken free! Odin sleeps, while Loki has claimed the throne of Asgard! In short, all Ragnarok is about to break loose! Stan Lee and Jack Kirby bring you another set of adventures with all the power and majesty that one of comics’ most-famous runs can bring. Even across their many epics of the Eternal Realm, none can match the build-up and battle that Stan and Jack have for you in these pages! When the dust settles, Loki’s evil spells lead to a body-swap between the God of Thunder and his mischievous half-brother that brings Thor to the gates of hell. With Kirby backed by none other than comics legend Neal Adams, it’s a comic-art lover’s dream! Then Big John Buscema steps up to carry the hammer and wastes no time making history when Thor journeys to Latveria. It’s a fight for the ages, and you’ll witness Dr. Doom’s horrible face revealed to boot! Also featuring Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime, Ulik the Troll, the Crypto-Man, the cosmic Stranger and earth-shaking Abomination and Mephisto! It’s page after page of action and adventure in the manner that made Marvel a household name. Collecting THOR #173-183\r\nAll Ages …$54.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4221-8",
