    "description": "Marc Spector is dead — is Jake Lockley about to join him? When your multiple personalities are driving you so crazy you have to kill one of them, it’s time for a vacation! Marc Spector was a soldier. A mercenary. A killer. And now, thanks to Moon Knight, he’s a dead man. But the avatar of Khonshu lives on in the form of Jake Lockley — a more laid-back personality who just wants to take a nice, relaxing trip in Mexico. But for him, this means bashing his way through bare-knuckle-fighting tournaments, hiring on for a “snatch and grab” on behalf of a rich and well-armed land baron, and going toe-to-toe with a guy named Frank Castle — who the criminal element knows better as the Punisher. AAA never recommended a trip like this, but then again, Moon Knight is no ordinary tourist! Collecting MOON KNIGHT #26-30.\r\nParental Advisory …$15.99",
