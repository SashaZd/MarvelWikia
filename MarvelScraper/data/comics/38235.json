    "description": "The teenaged Victor Von Doom defends his life…in Hell. The undergrad who’ll grow to become Dr. Doom is an abrasive young genius surrounded by collegiate buffoons, wastrels, and dilettantes – like that insufferable Richards. But Doom knows he’s destined for greater things, and from his dorm he journeys fearlessly to Hell to save the spirit of his mom…and his struggle to get there, the trials he faces, and his subsequent failure will make him the man he’s to become. Nick Spencer and Becky Cloonan pull back the cloak to reveal the youthful, angsty, exuberant side of Victor Von Doom!",
