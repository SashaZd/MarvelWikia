After rescuing a land baron’s daughter from corrupt Federales, the fugitive vigilante is suddenly thrust into the crosshairs of Mexico’s deadliest assassins looking to collect the bounty on the girl’s head.  But there are other predators prowling the dark underbelly of Mexico City, and not all of them have their sights on the innocent.  The Punisher has traveled down south on the trail of some Russian mobsters, and he’s just stepped onto blood-soaked turf that bears the unique signature of another killer. His name is Toltec, and if you’ve seen him, you’re dead.\r<br>Parental Advisory …$2.99\r<br>",
