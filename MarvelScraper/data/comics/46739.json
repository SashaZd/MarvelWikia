When Shingen humiliates Wolverine in front of Mariko, the hero loses heart, drowning his sorrows in beer, bar fights — and the arms of wild assassin Yukio. But when ninjas attack and betrayal strikes from a most unexpected source, can Wolverine reclaim his honor, and rescue Mariko and himself from the trap Shingen has drawn around them both? Then: The X-Men travel to Japan to rejoin their wayward teammate, but the villainous duo of Viper and the Silver Samurai want to guarantee that the mutants’ story won’t have a happy ending. It’s secrets, shockers and broken hearts in Wolverine’s legendary first solo adventure! Collecting WOLVERINE (1982) #1-4 and UNCANNY X-MEN (1963) #172-173.",
