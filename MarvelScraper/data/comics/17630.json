The Foolkiller has been brutally introduced to the human joke, and he  wants to make sure fools everywhere take note.  “A fool thinks himself wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool.”   Shakespeare said that.  He also said, “Hell is empty, and all the devils are here.”  He was right both times. The devil is here, and he’s got his sights set on the Foolkiller. His name is Sickle Moon, and he’s not much to  look at. But if you’ve seen him, you’re probably dead.\r<br>Cardstock Cover/Explicit Content …$3.99 \r<br>",
