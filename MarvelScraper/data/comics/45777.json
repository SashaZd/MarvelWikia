    "description": "The time-displaced young X-Men continue to adjust to a present day that’s simultaneously more awe-inspiring and more disturbing than any future the young heroes had ever imagined for themselves. As Jean Grey pushes her powers to the limit, shaking her and the rest of the X-Men to the core, one of the young X-Men breaks rank — and leaves to join the adult Cyclops and his revolutionary crew! And when Mastermind targets the young Jean, will history repeat itself? Plus: When the teens find themselves face-to-face with the Uncanny Avengers, young Cyclops meets the adult version of the brother he thought he’d never see again! They never warned us about this sort of thing in temporal mechanics class! Acclaimed writer Brian Michael Bendis further defines the future — and the past — of the X-Men! Collecting ALL-NEW X-MEN #11-15.",
