He and the X-Men find themselves locked in a high-stakes chess match with the prize being their respective visions of utopia — but which side of the board is Emma Frost on? And who are the Dark X-Men? Then: Cyclops has created a mutant nation off the coast of California, and Magneto’s sudden return has stunned the X-Men — but the hits keep coming as a herd of Predator X’s show up, hungry for mutant flesh!
