    "description": "“QUEEN CAPTURES BISHOP”\r\nAs it turns out, space isn’t the place for Cable and Hope.  Against all odds, Bishop has found them again, and taken their spacecraft hostage.  All Bishop needs is to see the girl.  Once he has visual confirmation, it’s simply a matter of triggering the nuclear bomb hidden in his arm, and his lifelong mission to save the X-Men (and Earth) is over.  And there are only so many places to hide in a small transport vessel on the far reaches of our solar system.  But there is someone else aboard the vessel, and she doesn’t care about Cable or Bishop’s war.  She’s been drawn to the life force of one of the vessel’s inhabitant, and she and her army will stop at nothing until they have her…Enter: The Brood Queen!\r\nRated T  …$2.99",
