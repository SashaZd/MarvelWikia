    "description": "Collecting four action-packed Punisher tales drawn by Laurence Campbell. First, a lurid tell-all book leads the Punisher on the trail of a hitwoman marked for death.  Who is Butterfly?  And will the Punisher be her salvation, her temptation, or her damnation? In GET CASTLE, Frank travels to a Welsh mountain range to unleash his unique brand of vengeance, but is he the hunter or the hunted? Next, to stop a murderous snuff film ring, Frank Castle has to infiltrate a building with a security system so tight that he can’t bring in any weapons.  Nothing.  Nada.  Just his own wits, inventiveness and ruthless efficiency. Plus: we’re all familiar with Punisher’s habit of rampaging through the criminal underworld, but what happens to those who survive? Find out in this gripping tale of one criminal’s quest to dish out his own brand of punishment on Frank Castle!
