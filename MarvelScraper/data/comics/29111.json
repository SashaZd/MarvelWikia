    "description": "Thor has answered the Avengers' call to action from day one, but the god of thunder has an even higher responsibility: to his worshippers. The Thunderer responds to entreaties from a dicatorship's denizens in a part of the world bad enough to have Doctor Doom for a neighbor! But not everyone's in favor of divine intervention, and it's Secretary of Defense Iron Man's job to get the god out — leaving Captain America to play referee between two of the world's biggest super-powers! Do the Avengers have a prayer of weathering this storm? Featuring She-Hulk, the Falcon, the Enchantress, the Warriors Three and more! Collecting AVENGERS (1998) #62-64, THOR (1998) #58 AND IRON MAN (1998) #64.\r\nRated T  …$24.99 \r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4467-0",
