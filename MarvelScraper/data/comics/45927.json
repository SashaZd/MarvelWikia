    "description": "S.H.I.E.L.D. has the Chameleon. The Superior Spider-Man wants him. That means it’s time to break into the Helicarrier! But can Spider-Man keep his secrets while facing off with the Secret Avengers — and S.H.I.E.L.D.’s newest resident, the Indestructible Hulk? When the Chameleon gets loose, it’s a recipe for disaster! Plus: The Punisher and Spider-Man have never seen eye-to-eye, but this is the Superior Spider-Man! What does Frank Castle think about Spider-Man’s new hard-edged attitude? Spidey has questions for the villainous Mysterio, but the Punisher has something else for him: bullets. And when Blackout targets Aunt May, the former Doc Ock’s resolve is tested in a major way — and so is his patience when Stilt-Man strikes, and he must team with Spidey’s old friend, Daredevil! Collecting AVENGING SPIDER-MAN #20-22, SUPERIOR SPIDER-MAN ANNUAL #1 and DAREDEVIL (2011) #22.",
