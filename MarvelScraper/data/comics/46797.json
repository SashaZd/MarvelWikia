    "description": "Because you demanded it! The X-Women get their own book, from critically acclaimed superstars Brian Wood (X-MEN, ULTIMATE X-MEN, DMZ, The Massive) and Olivier Coipel (AVX, HOUSE OF M, THOR)! An old enemy shows up at the X-Men's door, seeking asylum from an ancient evil. John Sublime is back, but he's not who we should be afraid of! Who or what is Arkea? Meanwhile, Jubilee returns home — with an orphaned baby who might hold the key to Earth's survival — or its destruction! Against a backdrop of what seems like an alien invasion and an eons-spanning war between brother and sister, Storm puts together a team to protect the child and stop a new threat that could destroy all life on the planet! Plus: Jubilee's classic first appearance! Collecting X-MEN (2013) #1-4 and UNCANNY X-MEN (1963) #244.",
