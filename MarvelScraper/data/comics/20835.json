    "description": "“VALLEY FORGE, VALLEY FORGE: THE SLAUGHTER OF A U.S. MARINE GARRISON AND THE BIRTH OF THE PUNISHER,” PART 1\r<br>Garth Ennis concludes his seminal run on PUNISHER -- in style.  Thirty-five years ago, the Fifth Cavalry disgorged their troops on an isolated Vietnamese hilltop and was met by a scene of utter devastation.  The final body count ran to well over seven-hundred -- almost 200 hundred of them American soldiers.  Standing alone amidst the carnage, a sole survivor: Captain Frank Castle, who years later would be known as the most fearsome vigilante to walk the Earth: The Punisher.  Now the Punisher is about to face his stiffest test: He’s hunted big game in his day, but none as big as this.  Five men with unlimited resources. Men who’d put anything between themselves and the Punisher’s bullet.  Men who know exactly who he is…and how to fight him.\r<br>Explicit Content …$2.99 \r<br>",
