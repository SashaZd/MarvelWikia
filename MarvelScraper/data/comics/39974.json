Meanwhile, back in the World, Sen. Robert Kennedy has an important day of his own. New soldiers enter the war, and old ones leave it — and there are too many bad ways to leave a war. Plus: The battle lines get even blurrier as enemies display their humanity, and soldiers show their darker sides. Includes rarely seen stories from Marvel's black-and-white magazines. Collecting THE 'NAM #21-30, and material from SAVAGE TALES (1985) #1 and #4.",
