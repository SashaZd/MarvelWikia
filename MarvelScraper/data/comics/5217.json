    "description": "Wolverine has been injured before, but never like this.  Blasted with 5,000 rounds of machine gun shells and lifted to the edge of earth’s atmosphere by a giant robot, Wolverine was 85,000 feet in the air when he finally disabled the killing machine.  Now, after a horrendous descent and fiery crash into a rural Nebraska cornfield, he lies at the edge of death, lapsing in and out of a coma as his body desperately tries to heal.  And that’s when things really get bad.\r\n<br>The men who sent the robot to destroy Wolverine have come to finish the job.  The townsfolk who witnessed the crash have gathered up a mob to hunt down and destroy the alien that’s landed.  And Wolverine’s fate just might rest in the hands of the strange little girl who first found him in that dark cornfield.  A strange little girl with an affinity for taking care of odd creatures, and whose family holds a deep, dark secret hidden from the light of day... House of Blood and Sorrow is an all new 34-page chilling story just in time for Halloween!  Written by David Lapham (Stray Bullets) and illustrated by David Aja (Daredevil, X-Men Unlimited)\r\n<br>This Giant Size edition also includes a special Classic tie-in to Wolverine Origins with reprints of X-Men 6 and 7 by Jim Lee, featuring Omega Red and Sabretooth!\r\n<br>96 PGS./ Rated T  ...$4.99\r\n<br>",
