Now, taking to the timestream, Doom may have just what he needs to defeat his sworn enemy forever. To prevail, the Fantastic Four will need the help of one of their oldest allies: the Amazing Spider-Man! Never a team player, Spider-Man must learn to work well with others — or it just might mean the end of them all. Plus: a classic two-part team-up featuring the FF and the web-slinger!
