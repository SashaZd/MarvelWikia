    "description": "Spider-Man must contend with the cold-blooded combination of the Lizard and Morbius â€” one a rampaging reptile that may have cut the cord with his human host forever, the other a scientific genius with a vampiric lust for human blood. Morbius has developed a cure for the Lizard â€” but is there anything left of Dr. Curt Connors to save? Who exhumed the body of Connorsâ€™ late son, Billy? And how can Spidey trust Morbius when every time he turns around, the Living Vampire is sinking his teeth into yet another victim? The answers come fast and furious in a frightening tale that reminds readers that when it comes to senses-shattering savagery, no one can stand with the Lizard! Collecting AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (1963) #688-691 and UNTOLD TALES OF SPIDER-MAN #9.",
