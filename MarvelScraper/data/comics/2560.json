    "description": "The destinies of most people are defined early on.  Then there are the others – the lost.  Those whose numbers aren’t in yet, who could go toward the light or toward the darkness – indeed, who could be tipped one direction or another.  And everything starts with the book.  That’s what Jonathan is about to discover.  When he took a suicide plunge off the London Bridge more than a century ago, the last place he expected to land was on his feet, in the present, standing at the entrance to a tunnel into a world of mysteries beyond his wildest imagination.  A world of powers and principalities and, above all, rules that he’d best learn quickly.  Or he’ll have to deal with the Dark Man. And what the Dark Man can’t turn, he devours.\r<br>\r<br>32 PGS./T+ SUGGESTED FOR TEENS AND UP …$2.99\r<br>",
