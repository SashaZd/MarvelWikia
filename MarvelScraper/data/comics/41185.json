    "description": "The psychic vampire Selene is on a mad quest to devour enough souls to let her ascend to godhood, commencing a terrible reign over the planet. And though X-Force stands ready to destroy her plans at any cost, the Black Queen has summoned backup that may just tilt the balance in her favor: an army of undead mutants composed of X-Force&rsquo;s former friends and foes, resurrected into gruesome half-life by the techno-organic virus gifted to her by Eli Bard. And first and foremost among Selene&rsquo;s newest servants are former teammate Caliban and Warpath&rsquo;s older brother, Thunderbird. While X-Force fights an unsettling battle against familiar faces, Selene puts her true plan into action: the resurrection, and immediate sacrifice, of the entire population of Genosha. Can X-Force obtain the one weapon capable of stopping Selene in time, or will death and decay overtake the entire world? Collecting X-NECROSHA: THE GATHERING, X-FORCE (2008) #21-25 and material from X-NECROSHA.\r\n200 PGS./Parental Advisory &#133;$19.99",
