    "description": "This deluxe hardcover collects ULTIMATE FANTASTIC FOUR VOL. 5: CROSSOVER and ULTIMATE FANTASTIC FOUR VOL. 6: FRIGHTFUL, plus extras. In Crossover, it's the rise of the Marvel Zombies! Even in their short careers, the Ultimate FF have seen a lot of amazing things – but nothing will prepare them for the world they’re about to enter! Reed Richards has used his scientific genius to contact an Earth in a surprisingly familiar parallel dimension – and he’s ready to visit! Plus: The shocking secret of the Storm family is finally revealed! Locked away at the bottom of the ocean for 5,000 years, Namor the Sub-Mariner’s Atlantean tomb has been breached; now, he’s back to rule a planet. This is a Namor you’ve never seen before with a vastly different agenda. This is Ultimate Namor! Learn about the ties between Atlantis, the Ultimate Inhumans and the super-races that existed before man ruled the Earth! And in Frightful, guilt-ridden Reed Richards attempts to undo his greatest failure by using time travel to fix the snag that caused the teleportation accident that resulted in Ben Grimm becoming the Thing. If it works, Ben will be Ben and the Thing will never have existed. And neither will the FF. Be careful what you wish for! Plus: the awesome return of Dr. Doom! The zombiefied FF escape from their Baxter Building prison! The deadly debut of the Frightful Four! Johnny Storm finds out he has only 28 days to live! And that’s all just for starters!
