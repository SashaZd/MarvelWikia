    "description": "Not so long ago, the Punisher attempting to assassinate the Green Goblin would most likely have been met with ambivalence. But Norman Osborn has decided he prefers suits to green masks and the authoritarian law-enforcement agency H.A.M.M.E.R. to a weapons-enhanced glider. So when Castle put the former super villain in his sites, it wasn’t received quite as well. Since that failed assassination attempt, Osborn has tried to turn the tables on the Punisher. Despite his best efforts, Castle has eluded him to continue his surgical strikes on H.A.M.M.E.R.’s centers of power. With traditional means of bringing in his foe exhausted, Osborn turns to the Hood and his wide-reaching criminal network. Resurrecting 16 super villains killed by extreme vigilantes, he promises the super-powered thugs a second chance at life — if they bring him the head of Frank Castle! Collecting PUNISHER #6-10 and PUNISHER ANNUAL #1.\r\nParental Advisory …$16.99 \r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4162-4",
