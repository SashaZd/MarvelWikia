And after a mutant-triggered international incident, anti-mutant hatred hits new heights. Of course it's at this moment, when the mutant race most needs to stand together, that a split begins that will tear apart the very foundation of the X-Men. From superstar writer and Marvel Architect Jason Aaron and a full roster of comics' top artists, this is an X-tale that will reverberate for years to come! When the dust settles, the X-Men landscape will be irreparably changed. Collecting X-MEN: SCHISM #1-5, GENERATION HOPE #10-11 and X-MEN: REGENESIS.",
