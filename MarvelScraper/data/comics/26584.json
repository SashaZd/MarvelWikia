    "description": "When a low-level S.H.I.E.L.D. agent gets a hold of Hank Pym’s new Ant-Man suit, you know the Marvel Universe is in trouble. He’s not concerned with saving the world or helping others. He’s concerned with getting through the day and getting a leg up on life. He’s not going to use his powers responsibly, he’s going to use them for the betterment of himself. He’s Ant-Man, a new “hero” for the modern world. But it also costs money to be on the run from the law. Luckily, Damage Control is on the lookout for someone who can safely sift through rubble for survivors. Don't worry, though – he'll still have plenty of time to spy on the ladies like the despicable human-being that he is. If you thought Robert Kirkman pushed the boundaries of what could be in a Marvel Comic with MARVEL ZOMBIES, just wait until you see what he does in here! Collecting IRREDEEMABLE ANT-MAN #1-12.\r\nRated T  …$34.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4086-3",
