    "description": "The Hulk thought he was finally rid of Bruce Banner, his puny alter ego split from him and incinerated in the blast of a Gamma bomb. But somehow, buried deep in the Hulk’s mind, a twisted, insane Banner is back. And when the Hulk calms down, the maniacal doctor comes out to play. As Banner uses every opportunity to further his intricate plot, the Hulk fights to stay in the game in ever more bizarre locales. In a desperate bid to keep Banner at bay, the Hulk must stay angry! Writer Jason Aaron’s paradigm-shifting run roars to a conclusion as the Hulk faces drug-dealing dogs, backwater Atlanteans, Russian bears in space and a hidden city of sasquatches — not to mention Kraven the Hunter, the Punisher, the Thing, Wolverine and Dr. Doom! Collecting INCREDIBLE HULK (2011) #7.1 & #8-15.",
