    "description": "Wolverine dies! This is it: The story that takes Marvel's feral mutant to the limit – and beyond! With Wolverine reduced to a brain-dead vegetable, you'd think that was the end of his adventures – but it's actually just the beginning of Logan’s greatest challenge yet. Guest-starring Iron Man and Dr. Strange! Plus: All a recently divorced, down-on-his-luck ex-cop, Wendell Rayfield, has going for him is his new job. A job that involves a very large machine gun, a hole in the ground, a certain hirsute mutant and several thousand bullets. We all know what damage Wolverine can do with his claws, but how dangerous can he really be when all he's able to do is talk? Wendell Rayfield is about to find out.
