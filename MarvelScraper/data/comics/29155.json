    "description": "Skaar has cut a swathe of destruction and mayhem across the alien world of Sakaar unrivaled in the planet’s violent history. But when the son of Hulk comes into possession of the ancient force known as the Old Power, it seems no one will be able to stop his quest for blood — no one but the Silver Surfer, that is. But does the Sentinel of the Spaceways really plan to rescue Sakaar? Or does his arrival mark the coming of a threat even greater than the Hulk’s wrathful son — the coming of Galactus, devourer of worlds? The battle that follows takes Skaar from his homeworld to Earth, a planet caught in the grips of Norman Osborn’s ruthless rise to power and thoroughly unprepared for the savage warrior. Sparks fly when the Fantastic Four and the Sensational She-Hulk cross paths with the rampaging Skaar, but nothing can prepare the world for what comes next: the reunion of father and son! What will happen when these two unstoppable forces meet? Only one thing is certain: nothing will ever be the same again! Collecting SKAAR: SON OF HULK #7-12 and PLANET SKAAR PROLOGUE.\r\nParental Advisory …$24.99 \r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-2821-2",
