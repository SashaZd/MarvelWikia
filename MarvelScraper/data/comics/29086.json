    "description": "In the wake of the superhero Civil War, outlaw Avengers Luke Cage, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Spider-Woman, Dr. Strange and Iron Fist are still fighting the good fight, joined by two new recruits: mistress of mimicry Echo and long-lost Avengers mainstay Hawkeye, now Ronin. But when the heroes uncover evidence of a secret invasion by shape-shifting Skrulls, paranoia starts to tear the team apart. Who can they trust when any one of them might be an alien monster in disguise? Which Avenger betrays the group? And can the embattled rebel Avengers survive when new supernatural crime boss the Hood targets them with an army of super villains? And, join Iron Man, Professor X, Black Bolt, the Sub-Mariner and Mister Fantastic as they take on the threats no one else can handle – and learn of secrets that will forever alter the way they (and you) look at the Marvel Universe! After years spent protecting Earth from harm, it is now when the planet is perhaps at its most endangered – as the Illuminati find themselves at the head of the spear of a Skrull invasion. But can the Illuminati keep themselves from fracturing in the waking moments of this worldwide threat?
