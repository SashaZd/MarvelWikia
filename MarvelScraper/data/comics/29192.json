    "description": "Will the real Ms. Marvel please stand up? Though she was once the ruthless super villain Moonstone, Karla Sofen has taken to her new role as Ms. Marvel. Proudly assuming membership in Norman Osborn’s Avengers, the new Ms. Marvel has set out to solve the problems that her deceased predecessor, Carol Danvers, couldn’t. But when Danvers is miraculously brought back to life, she isn’t pleased about her replacement. The two women holding the mantle of Ms. Marvel throw themselves at one another, each eager to prove what kind of hero she is and secure that coveted title for herself. As Sofen and Danvers fight across Los Angeles, the entire city’s eyes are on them — including those of Catherine Donovan, who also appears to be Carol Danvers. Which of these three women is the true Ms. Marvel, and will she be able to beat out her imposters? Collecting MS. MARVEL #42-46.\r\nRated T  …$14.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-3841-9",
