His healing factor's down, and the only thing that'll juice it up is a dose of the Incredible Hulk's blood  administered by the Weapon X alumnus who helped make Deadpool what he is in the first place! Not even mad science can mend a torn heart, though, as Deadpool's infatuation with X-Force's Siryn (later of X-FACTOR) is challenged by Typhoid Mary who turns heads as easily as she cracks skulls! When she sets off on a grudge match against Daredevil, can Deadpool contain a killing machine even more off kilter than he is?
