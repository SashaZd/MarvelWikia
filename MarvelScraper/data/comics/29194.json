    "description": "Mockingbird and Hawkeye: two heroes, and former lovers, who cheated death. And now that they’re reunited from beyond the grave, they’ll have to try their hardest to keep from killing each other. It’s high-octane action and intrigue as the Mr. and Mrs. Smith of the Marvel Universe take on one of the biggest threats in the world...and each other! Thought dead when she was imprisoned on an alien world, Mockingbird’s home again — but the reunion is bittersweet as she finds that this Earth is a much harsher place than the one she left behind. The world is desperate for heroes — and after being caged for years, Mockingbird is eager to punch some bad guys. But when her ex-husband Clint Barton, the Avenger Ronin, tags along on her new secret mission, old wounds reopen fast. Can these two great heroes set aside their feelings long enough to save the day? If not, they might find it’s hard to cheat death a second time. Collecting NEW AVENGERS REUNION #1-4 and material from DARK REIGN: NEW NATION.\r\nRated A …$14.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-3855-6",
