    "description": "The one and only First Family of Super-Heroing continue their mind-bogglingly imaginative adventures in stories crafted by some of the medium’s greatest storytellers. Lead by Stan “The Man” Lee—in the culmination of his incomparable FF run—and the phenomenal artistry of John Buscema and Joe Sinnott, Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Girl, the Human Torch and the ever-lovin’ blue-eyed Thing face-off against their greatest adversary ever. In a word…Galactus! The world devourer returns and either the Silver Surfer must submit to his will or the Earth dies! It’s a four-part epic that will make a True Believer out of comic fans young and old. That’s worth the price of admission alone, but since we’re so nice there’s also the Human Torch’s struggle to rescue his ladylove Crystal from the alchemical clutches of Diablo; a progressive parable of social consciousness in the Marvel Manner that Stan Lee championed; the secret of the Monster from the Lost Lagoon; and Roy Thomas’ regular-series writing debut on a three-part saga featuring the menacing Mole Man and sultry Kala, Queen of the Netherworld—and topped of with a retelling of the FF’s origin! Guest-starring the Inhumans, the Black Panther, the world’s weirdest babysitter—Agatha Harkness—and Richard Nixon, it’s a comic extravaganza as only mighty Marvel can make them!
