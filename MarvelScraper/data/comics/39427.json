Learning he had gained great arachnid-like abilities, the timid teenager donned a colorful costume of his own design — seeking fame and fortune as the Amazing Spider-Man! But his Uncle Ben's death — a tragedy he could have prevented — taught Peter that with great power, there must also come great responsibility. And on that day, a legend was born!
