This summer, Daredevil and the Punisher vie for the soul of Hell’s Kitchen as half of the East Coast’s underworld — in chaos since Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin of crime, was deposed — scramble for their shot at the big chair. And as the city descends into chaos—as murder and intimidation become the staples of the day — Daredevil and the Punisher each seek to restore order in their own unique way. For Daredevil — who’s anointed himself the new “Kingpin” of the city — this means dispensing justice at the end of a billy club. But for the Punisher, justice at the end of a billy club isn’t justice at all. For the Punisher, justice for these animals is at the end of a shotgun. Featuring more Marvel villains than you can shake a stick at — including Hammerhead and the return of the nefarious…Jackal!!\r<br>32 PGS./Marvel PSR+ …$2.99\r<br>",
