    "description": "It’s an all-new, all-different version of the X-Men as told by some of Europe’s greatest comics storytellers!  In this vivid re-imagining of the X-Men mythos, everything is not as it seems and teenaged versions of Cyclops, Beast, Wolverine, Iceman, Storm and Rogue face a threat worse even than super villains or race-destroying viruses… HIGH SCHOOL! Xavier’s students face the deadly Sentinel robots, but is it Magnus who unleashed this threat, or someone even more dangerous? The gang will need some unlikely allies if they hope to stop the Sentinels’ wave of destruction, and not everyone will make it out alive!\r\nRated T  …$4.99",
