That’s right: Someone’s framed Deadpool, and it just might be the same guy who hired him in the first place, a guy who just might be using the mouthy merc as a wild card in a twisted wager.  If Wade’s going to clear his name and serve up some revenge, he’s first got to avoid getting captured -- or killed -- by some of the Marvel Universe’s heaviest hitters: Daredevil, the Punisher and Spider-Man.\r<br>Parental Advisory …$3.99\r<br>",
