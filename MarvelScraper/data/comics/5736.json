    "description": "You keep that motor revved up and those tires burning, your blazing bike racing hot into the night. You’re Ghost Rider, and there’s no holding you back – because the devil has always got you on the run! MARVEL SPOTLIGHT brings fans of the demon with the flaming skull this special issue that covers Ghost Rider from all sides! We talk with the creative teams of the new GHOST RIDER ongoing series (Daniel Way, Mark Texeira and Javier Saltares) and the epic mini-series SPIRITS OF VENGEANCE (Garth Ennis and Clayton Crain). They’ve each staked a claim on a little piece of Ghost Rider’s soul, and we’ll be there for the full scoop! We’ll also have an in-depth look at Ghost Rider from throughout Marvel history, taking a hard look at the early days of Johnny Blaze through the Danny Ketch years of the nineties. And since Ghost Rider will hit the big screen in February, look for heavy coverage of the feature film – including interviews with the cast and crew that’ll get your motor primed and ready for the opening night!\r<br>40 PGS./No Ads/Rated T+ ...$2.99\r<br>",
