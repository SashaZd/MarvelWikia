    "description": "In a saloon in the town of Tull, the last gunslinger is approached by a bizarre figure that has a message for him. The message is terrifying. What's worse, it is delivered by a dead man named Nort whose corpse was animated to serve this very purpose. And that is only the beginning of the horrors awaiting the gunslinger in this strange place deep within Mid-World.  We continue Roland Deschain's quest for the Man in Black that has become his obsession. Featuring the artistic talents of Michael Lark, whose fine pencils have graced the pages of Daredevil and Spider-Man.",
