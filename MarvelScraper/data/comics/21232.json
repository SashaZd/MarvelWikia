But it seems that danger lurks everywhere.  The castle's ghostly owner wants nothing more than to steal Kerrigan's magical sword, even if it means leaving our dark knight-and those whom he protects-vulnerable to Morgen's machinations.  How long will Kerrigan be able to keep his location secret from the evil mistress of enchantment? And has Seren really fallen for her captor though she knows, full well, that he could easily kill her?
