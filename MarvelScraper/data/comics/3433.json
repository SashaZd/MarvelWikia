After a brief hiatus caused by their, ahem, deaths, everyone's favorite mutants are back!  And this time, they�re bringing a host of questions with them.

When the Pitiful One decides that he's tired of being dead, he assembles a posse of Marvel's deadest villains to attack the world of the living. And it's up to Doctor Strange to stop him and his evil cohorts�but he needs help from...well, you know. With Kraven the Hunter, Tike Alicar, and a few other surprise, dead guests.\n<br>32 PGS./ PARENTAL ADVISORY ...$2.99\n<br>",
