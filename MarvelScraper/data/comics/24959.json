    "description": "Remember when Deadpool saved the Earth from those pesky Skrulls? Well, the guy who stole the intel Deadpool worked so hard to acquire -- and positioned himself as Earth’s Number One War Hero -- wants to make sure you don’t. The last thing this guy needs is a certain “Merc with a Mouth” letting everyone know the truth of how he saved the day, and he’s hired a certain maniacal man-eater to make sure Deadpool never does. Here comes Tiger-Shark! Plus, a surprise appearance by a certain palindromic pal! Then, Norman Osborn is through playing around with Deadpool—it’s time to send in the big guns. The big, crazy guns that never, ever miss.  He may be wearing a new costume, but he’s still the same ol’ psychopath…\r\nCollecting DEADPOOL #6-7 & #10-12.\r\nParental Advisory …$19.99",
