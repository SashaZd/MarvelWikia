    "description": "Cyclops &mdash; destroyer of worlds? After presiding over a mutant schism as leader of the X-Men, it looks like a visit from Storm may make Cyclops himself again &mdash; but it quickly becomes apparent that Storm is not herself, either. She&rsquo;s from another reality &mdash; one in which Cyclops soon finds himself a prisoner. And the key to his survival rests in his fellow captives, although they aren&rsquo;t the X-Men he knows. Alongside General James Howlett, Cyclops will battle this world&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;Savior&rdquo; to save himself and countless other mutants. But there&rsquo;s a reason Savior has been gathering and sacrificing mutants from other worlds. And if Cyclops is to liberate himself and his strange new friends, it may mean dooming this planet and all its inhabitants! Collecting ASTONISHING X-MEN (2004) #44-47 and material from ASTONISHING X-MEN: GHOST BOXES #1.",
