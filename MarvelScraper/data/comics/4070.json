Now, Foggy Nelson lies in his grave, and Matt, blaming himself, is running wild in Rykers, determined to find out who put his best friend at the end of a knife. This is Daredevil as you've never seen him before, unplugged from his own sense of right and wrong, alone in the cold walls of the system he's spent his life defending, and the only thing on his mind is vengeance!",
