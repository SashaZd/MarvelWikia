    "description": "As America began preparation for the inevitable entry in World War II, a secret military project gave birth to the greatest one-man fighting force ever known—Captain America! Transformed by the Super Soldier Serum from a 97-pound weakling into the Star-Spangled Avenger, Steve Rogers led the charge to liberate the world from the Axis powers’ grasp. But before the war’s end an accident left Cap frozen in suspended animation and his sidekick Bucky dead, while the world turned on for decades. When the Avengers finally resuscitated him, Steve Rogers was greeted by a world vastly changed. He was a man out of time tormented by the death of his partner, but no less committed to the cause of fighting evil in all its forms. In this inaugural Silver Age Captain America collection, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby bring you the rebirth of an American icon in issue after issue of classic Marvel magic. You’ll read the classic origins of Cap, Bucky and the Red Skull; see the first appearances of such cornerstone creations as the cosmic cube and the beautiful Sharon Carter; and watch Cap face off against Baron Zemo’s Army of Assassins, the Sleepers, Batroc the Leaper, and his Nazi nemesis the Red Skull!
