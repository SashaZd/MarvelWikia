    "description": "Before he presided over S.H.I.E.L.D., before he ran with the Howling Commandos, Sgt. Nick Fury fought on the blood-stained sands of the Tunisian desert.  When his entire platoon was massacred by General Stephen Barkhorn and his 21st Panzer Division, Fury stumbled off into the desert toward certain death.  Instead, he came face to face with his future.  \r<br>\r<br> Now, he’s on a desperate mission that is integral to defeating the Nazi regime. Assigned with the task of slipping behind enemy lines and assassinating General Barkhorn himself, Fury discovers a series of challenges in his way—deadly fighter planes, armed sentries, and most significantly, a shocking revelation that will force Fury to do the one thing every good soldier should avoid: question his orders. \r<br>\r<br>In this gripping limited series, Garth Ennis (Ghost Rider, Punisher) and Darick Robertson (Punisher: Born) offer a never-before-seen glimpse into soul of a warrior you only think you know.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>32 PGS./Rated T+ SUGGESTED FOR TEENS AND UP …$3.50\r<br>",
