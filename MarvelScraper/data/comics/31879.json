    "description": "You are Petty Officer Spartan-117, better known as the Master Chief. An enhanced super soldier fitted out with the most advanced array of tactical weapons imaginable and a suit of assault armor that will protect you against the most lethal of attacks. Your target is the Forerunner Dreadnought. It is a command craft miles long, miles wide, filled to the brim with hostile Covenant forces and heading for Earth to activate the world-shattering weapon known as Halo. It’s time to lock, load and save billions of people — or die trying. Brought to you by two graphic-arts visionaries, Brian Michael Bendis (NEW AVENGERS, SECRET INVASION) and Alex Maleev (DAREDEVIL, NEW AVENGERS: ILLUMINATI), the story of Halo: Uprising fills in the gap between the conclusion of Bungee’s blockbuster video game Halo 2 and the record-setting entertainment juggernaut Halo 3. Collecting HALO: UPRISING #1-4 and MARVEL SPOTLIGHT: HALO.\r\n17 & Up …$19.99",
