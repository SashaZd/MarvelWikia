In a last-ditch effort to end Megacrime’s manhunt, Daredevil convinces the heroes to attack the rival crime families, drawing them in to witness the drive’s destruction while turning its secrets over to the Avengers. But the plan goes pear-shaped and Daredevil’s life hangs in the balance when one hero betrays the group in exchange for the power to bring the international criminal network to its knees! Plus, Matt Murdock enjoys a first date with Assistant D.A. Kirsten McDuffie — until the Black Spectre shows up looking for the drive! Collecting DAREDEVIL (2011) #11-15, AVENGING SPIDER-MAN #6 and PUNISHER (2011) #10.",
