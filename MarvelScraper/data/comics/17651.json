            "text": "Following up on the shocking conclusion of THE ORDER #6: the United States military is on high alert. Civilians are being evacuated. S.H.I.E.L.D. has been mobilized. The eyes of the entire world are on southern California and the international crisis unfolding there...and standing between it and a happy ending is Henry Hellrung, the leader of the Order. In this special issue marking the midway point of THE ORDER's first year and revisiting several key moments in Marvel history, Henry—unproven, untested, and unaccustomed to operating on a global scale, especially when there are millions of lives on the line—finds himself alone in a room with a man that could end the world as we know it. If he wins, the Order might just have a chance to survive. If Henry fails—we're all doomed. No pressure there, guy. By Matt Fraction (IMMORTAL IRON FIST, Casanova) and Barry Kitson (Legion of Super-Heroes, Empire). \r<br>Rated T+ …$2.99  \r<br>"
