    "description": "In the small, God-fearing town of Redemption Valley, a young boy’s body is found dead and mutilated. Is it a ritualistic killing? The local bad boy, Joel Flood, is arrested and put in jail.  A black-garbed, \"devil-worshipping\" metalhead, he must be guilty…or is he?\r<br>Enter attorney and super hero Matt Murdock, brought in to save the troubled teen from what looks like a witch-hunt by an outraged community desperate for justice…and the death penalty.  This may be the most important case of Matt’s career. A loss means justice denied and certain death for his client!  \r<br>Rising star David Hine (DISTRICT X) teams with critically acclaimed talent Michael Gaydos (POWERLESS, ALIAS) to tell this dark and gothic story of prejudice, justice, and punishment, inspired by the true story of \"The Robin Hood Hills Murders.\" \r<br>",
