    "description": "Iron Man was forged out of advanced technology, but now that same future tech threatens to doom Tony Stark. A dangerous terrorist has ingested a techno-organic virus called Extremis, transforming him into a superhuman killing machine. Now immensely powerful, but driven mad by the virus’ effects, the Extremis creature seems unstoppable. To halt this madman’s psychotic rampage, Iron Man must face the Extremis virus head-on — in a life-or-death battle that will drive Tony Stark closer than ever to the thin line between man and machine. Experience Warren Ellis’s blockbuster reimagining of the armored Avenger like never before in this new adaptation!",
