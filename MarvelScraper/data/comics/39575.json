    "description": "Continuing their greatest-hits streak on the “The World’s Greatest Comic Magazine,” Stan Lee and Jack Kirby weren’t content just to introduce the Inhumans, Galactus and the Silver Surfer. No, a three-peat was thinking far, far smaller than the most amazing team in comics’ history imagined. Their followup was a heart-wrenching tale of tragedy and heroism titled “This Man! This Monster!” If this story doesn’t make you come to love Benjamin J. Grimm, then yer heart must be made of orange rock, fella! Because the greatest Fantastic Four story wasn’t enough, Stan and Jack had yet another unmatched milestone waiting in the wings: the debut of the world’s first African super hero, the Black Panther, and his kingdom of Wakanda! And that’s just the start! In the pages of this MARVEL MASTERWORKS, you’ll also encounter the vile Klaw; see the Silver Surfer go toe-to-toe with the Thing; watch the Human Torch face his namesake, the original 1940s Torch; and wonder in shock and awe at how the Fantastic Four can hope to overcome Dr. Doom when he’s wrested the Power Cosmic from the Surfer himself! We can’t guarantee you won’t wear out the pages of this volume reading stories this great again and again! You may want to order two just in case! Collecting FANTASTIC FOUR #51-60 and ANNUAL #4.",
