    "description": "Colossus’ 7-year-old sister Illyana Rasputin has been snatched away by Belasco, demon lord of Limbo! Though the X-Men rescue her what seems like seconds later, those seconds represent a years-long ordeal for Illyana — one that starts with losing a piece of her soul, and goes downhill fast! The sorceress Ororo and feline warrior Cat — alternate-reality versions of X-Men Storm and Kitty Pryde — aid young Illyana against the terrors of Limbo, including Belasco’s henchman S’ym and a twisted, perverse version of Nightcrawler. Trained in good and evil magic, Illyana learns to control Limbo’s teleporting Stepping Discs — but as the final battle against Belasco arrives, can good triumph over evil when Illyana doesn’t know which one she is anymore? Collecting UNCANNY X-MEN (1963) #160 and MAGIK (1983) #1-4.",
