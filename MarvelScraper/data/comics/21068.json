    "description": "Where were you when Captain America died? Perhaps you were listening to the radio or reading the morning paper. Maybe you were surfing the web or on the phone with a friend. You were probably shocked, most likely thinking, “How could they? How could this happen to Cap?” And for a moment, you perhaps thought about all the ways the super soldier meant something to you. Something very real, very abiding. FALLEN SON: DEATH OF CAPTAIN AMERICA follows the reaction of the legendary heroes' best friends and closest comrades as they struggle to work through the emotions stirred by the loss of their ally, and the stages of grief that make them confront the part they may have played in that loss. Wolverine. The Avengers. Hawkeye. Spider-Man. Iron Man. All have their own sense of loss, their own levels of grieving. This is their story. This is Cap’s story. This is our story. The story of a Fallen Son and the world he helped make a better place.
