The divisiveness of Civil War has spread to his own team: Half of them want to cooperate with the government; the other half wants to take a stand against it.

And matters aren’t being helped by Quicksilver, who offers Rictor the opportunity to get his powers back -- but at what price? Plus: They've been a thorn in X-Factor’s side since the beginning, and now things are coming to a head.

The result is revelations that strike to the very core of who and what Jamie Madrox is. Collecting X-FACTOR #7-12.\r<br>144 PGS./Rated T+ …$19 .99\r<br>",
