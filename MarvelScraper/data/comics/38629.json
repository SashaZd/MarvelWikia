It's Superior versus Abraxas in the middle of New York and thousands of innocent people dying every time someone throws a punch. Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass) has already snapped up the rights for this book meaning Millar has yet another movie franchise he can boast about. Buy this now while it's still cheap.
