    "description": "From the mind of Monte Cook comes an exhilarating adventure set in his groundbreaking world of Ptolus, the City by the Spire.Sheva Callister thought she was retired after a tough “treasure hunting” expedition went sour and claimed the life of her partner, Parnell. But when a high-ranking noble from the city of Ptolus calls on her to retrieve a special brooch, she’s willing to venture out on one last expedition… for the right price. Ptolus is anything but a straightforward city, though, and as Sheva works her way towards her goal, she finds herself caught in a web of deception and intrigue. And as she travels from the tombs of the Lich King Narros to the towers overlooking the City by the Spire, Sheva quickly realizes she must find the source of this misery if she hopes to complete her quest… or else the powers-that-be in Ptolus may put a stop to her adventuring forever.  Written by Monte Cook, co-designer of the d20 gaming system and creator of the HeroClix battle system, Ptolus: City by the Spire is a wonderful introduction to the realm of “the world’s most deluxe campaign set,” with an amazing tale of swords and sorcery that’s sure to delight any fan of fantasy, thievery, or high-spirited adventure!\r<br>144 PGS./Rated T+ …$14.99\r<br>",
