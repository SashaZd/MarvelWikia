But what connects the battle that forever rages against the Norse godhood with a Zemo-led Nazi plot set in 1939? And what secrets lie inside the mind of a man enrolled in the European Super-Soldier Program and deemed mentally unstable by scientists? These three story strands merge in a masterful narrative full of excitement and drama â€” with action that takes readers from Midgard to Valhalla while exploring the origin of Thor and the majesty of fabled Asgard! Collecting ULTIMATE COMICS THOR #1-4."
