Young Loki is at a severe disadvantage: everyone in Asgard remembers him from his previous life—but they're all strangers to him, and they fully intend to keep it that way. Desperate, Loki conjures up a mystical means of eavesdropping on their private thoughts; and what he learns doesn't make him happy. Even worse, the lesson itself may just cost him his life! A perfect jumping-on point, showcasing Loki's relationships with Asgard's movers and shakers, and setting the stage for the choices he makes in the months to come."
