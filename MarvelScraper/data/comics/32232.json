That is, until two years ago, Cable disappeared for parts unknownâ€¦and a certain Merc with a Mouth took up the slack.  But now Cable has reemerged from where he claims is the far-flung future to take back his old job.  How will that sit with Deadpool?  Like Tacos before bedtime.  Itâ€™s super-agent vs super-agent in a fight to the finish.",
