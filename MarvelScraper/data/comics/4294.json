    "description": "Each month, the SPOTLIGHT office gets to cover a pair of Marvel’s biggest and brightest creators, and each month we wonder how we’ll ever top our last effort. Well, try this month’s Spotlight on for size: NEIL GAIMAN and SALVADOR LARROCA! Top that! On your short list of respected writers from the last couple decades of comics that have broken through to popular acceptance, you’ve got Alan Moore and...Brother Neil! This is a guy who defined a whole genre of comics with his breakout hit Sandman, has developed into a successful novelist and screenwriter, has collected 13 Eisners and a Hugo Award, and is getting ready to tackle Jack Kirby’s ETERNALS pantheon for Marvel Comics! Nahhh....we’ll have nothing to talk about with him! And what’s there to say about Salvador Larroca besides the fact that he’s one of the best artists working today? Well...lots, actually! For one thing, we wanna know why he’s so great; how he can be so prolific; and what it is that inspires the drama, power and sensuality he brings to his pages! Whether it’s the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, Elektra or Spider-Man, he’s been entrusted with Marvel’s biggest characters for a reason – and SPOTLIGHT will cover his career from top to bottom, with a special focus on his current work on Peter Milligan’s X-MEN. \r<br>32 PGS./NO ADS/Rated T+ ...$2.99\r<br>",
