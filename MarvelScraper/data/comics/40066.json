    "description": "The X-Men event of the decade starts here!  It's never been a more dangerous time to be a mutant. Even with their numbers at a record low, the world refuses to trust mutantkind...and after a mutant-triggered international incident, anti-mutant hatred hits new heights. Of course it's at this moment, when the mutant race needs most to stand together, that a split begins that will tear apart the very foundation of the X-Men. From superstar writer and Marvel Architect Jason Aaron and a full roster of comics' top artists, this is an X-tale that will reverberate for years to come! Come October, the X-Men landscape will be irreparably changed.",
