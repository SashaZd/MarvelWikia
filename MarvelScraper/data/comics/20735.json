    "description": "This deluxe hardcover collects PUNISHER MAX VOL. 7: MAN OF STONE and PUNISHER MAX VOL. 8: WIDOWMAKER, plus extras. In MAN OF STONE, two new players arrive to work out a lethal grudge as British Special Forces and Taliban insurgents face off in the Afghan highlands. One is Frank Castle, the man they call the Punisher. The other is General Nikolai Alexandrovich Zakharov, Soviet war criminal, known as the Man of Stone. Neither will stop until the other is dead – and Zakharov has brought not only a platoon of elite shock troops, but CIA traitor Rawlins, blackest of black operators. Castle has allies of his own, but this is old, bad, bloody country. You go to war in Afghanistan...and everybody dies. And in WIDOWMAKER, five Mafia widows are going to try what so many of their menfolk failed at: They're going to take the Punisher down. But they're not the only ones out for revenge. You spend your life married to organized crime, you end up with things in your past you'd rather forget. And for these women, the past is coming back in the worst way possible. Armed. Deadly. And hungry for justice.  Collecting PUNISHER #37-49.\r<br>Explicit Content …$29.99\r<br>ISBN: 978-0-7851-2867-0\r<br>",
