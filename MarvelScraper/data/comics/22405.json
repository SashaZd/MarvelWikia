    "description": "“In…BRAND NEW DAY, Peter Parker returns to his roots…” — USA Today\r<br>“(BRAND NEW DAY) is a very creative idea. It should stimulate a lot of interest in the characters and the books, and I'm eager to see what happens next.” — Stan Lee\r<br>The old Parker Luck is back! Desperately trying to scrouge up cash to pay the rent and keep his web-spinners recharged, Peter’s misfortunes are compounded by the wreckless antics of Overdrive, the nihilistic villainy of Mister Negative and the ominous threat of the high-flying Menace. And just who is the newest super hero in town — the stunning, red-haired Jackpot? The new Spidey Braintrust of writers — Dan Slott (SHE-HULK), Marc Guggenheim (WOLVERINE), Bob Gale (the Back to the Future trilogy) and Zeb Wells (PETER PARKER: SPIDER-MAN) — has loaded up BRAND NEW DAY with all the charm and freewheeling fun of classic Spider-Man, but with a fresh new take on super-hero action and drama. Brought to visual life by a bevy of today’s most peerless pencilers — like Steve McNiven (CIVIL WAR), Salvador Larroca (UNCANNY X-MEN) and Phil Jimenez (Infinite Crisis) — the stories of BRAND NEW DAY are restoring AMAZING SPIDER-MAN to a level of consistency and playfulness that can’t help but remind readers of the reason they fell in love with the’ol Webhead in the first place!
