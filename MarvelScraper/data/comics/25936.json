    "description": "Run for your lives! The marvel zombies are invading our world! The flesh-eating inhabitants of a parallel world have come to Earth, aiming to spread their virus in a full-scale biological invasion. Interdimensional defense agency A.R.M.O.R. recruits Aaron Stack — the joke-spewing, multiple-weapon wielding Machine Man — to travel to the zombie-infested world with his long-lost robot love, the Mighty Avenger known as Jocasta. The squabbling duo only has eight hours to obtain the blood needed to create an anti-zombie serum and defeat the undead epidemic. But if they don’t make it back in time, the Earth as we know it is doomed — especially as a zombie lurks within A.R.M.O.R.’s own secret headquarters! Collecting MARVEL ZOMBIES 3 #1-4.\r\nParental Advisory …$15.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-3526-5",
