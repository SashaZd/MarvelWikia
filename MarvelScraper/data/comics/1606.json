    "description": "This deluxe hardcover collects ULTIMATE X-MEN VOL. 7: BLOCKBUSTER and ULTIMATE X-MEN VOL. 8: NEW MUTANTS, plus a hefty helping of DVD-style extras. In BLOCKBUSTER, Wolverine returns to New York after a short time away from the X-Men — with a strange strike force armed with sophisticated military technology on his tail. To survive, he’s forced to rely on the Big Apple’s own Spider-Man and Daredevil — not to mention a little help from his fellow X-Men! In NEW MUTANTS, the President of the United States decides in the face of growing racism and paranoia between man and mutant that Professor X — with his mysterious psychic powers and shrouded background — might be the bigger problem. The President's solution: get the U.S. Government involved in the mutant-training business. With the help of Emma Frost, the President handpicks a class of \"New Mutants\" to serve his political agenda — including Dazzler, Karma, Havok and Polaris. But who is this mysterious Emma Frost and what is her connection to Xavier?",
