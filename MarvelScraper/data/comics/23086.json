    "description": "“SIX HOURS TO KILL,\" PART 1\r<br>The Punisher always knew he’d die on the job. But he didn’t know he’d have an expiration date.  After busting up a slave ring in downtown Philadelphia, Frank Castle has been tricked, trapped, gassed, strapped to a table and injected with a serum that will turn him into a 220-pound corpse by dawn -- six hours from now.  The people who grabbed him want him to do a simple little job and then they’ll give him the antidote -- simple, right?  Guess again.  The Punisher is nobody’s errand boy.  There’s only one thing he wants to do before he dies: Take as many bastards as he can with him.\r<br>Explicit Content …$3.99\r<br>",
