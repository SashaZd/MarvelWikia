Those whose numbers aren’t in yet, who could go toward the light or toward the darkness—indeed, who could be tipped one direction or another. Mob hitman Quint has always leaned farther towards the dark than the light, but when he is pursued by an enemy don he failed to kill, he’ll find himself at a crossroads, caught between his past loyalty to the Dark Man and the opportunity for salvation that Jonathan represents. J. Michael Straczynski (Amazing Spider-Man, Supreme Power) blends timeless fantasy with modern storytelling in this new ongoing series.\r<br>32 PGS./T+ SUGGESTED FOR TEENS AND UP ...$2.99\r<br>",
