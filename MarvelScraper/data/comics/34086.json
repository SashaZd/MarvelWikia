    "description": "Would Tony Stark still be Iron Man...if he wasn't Tony Stark? Twenty  years ago, in a college experiment gone bad, the young Stark's mind  is transferred to the body of impoverished but brilliant fellow  student, Victor von Doom! Blamed for the unsanctioned research, his  memory wiped clean, Tony is deported and forced to face life as a  disgraced Latverian commoner. Meanwhile, von Doom grows and flourishes  in the wealth and privilege of being sole heir to  tark Industries.  Thus, in separate cauldrons on different sides of the world, both Iron  Man and Dr. Doom are forged anew. But who are the men inside the  armors...really? Find out in \"WHAT IF TONY STARK HAD BECOME DR. DOOM?\", co-plotted and written by David Michelinie (\"IRON MAN: THE END\"), pencilled by Graham Nolan (\"X-MEN FOREVER\") and co-plotted  and inked by Bob Layton (\"HERCULES: TWILIGHT OF A GOD\").
