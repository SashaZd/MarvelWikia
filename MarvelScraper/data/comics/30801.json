    "description": "An all-new mystery for America's favorite necromancer! The last year has been a non-stop rollercoaster ride for Anita Blake, and it's nearing Halloween — peak time when you raise the dead for a living. Now, the police need Anita's help investigating a vampire killing that left the victim with three unique sets of bite marks, despite the fact vampires are normally solitary hunters. The attack must be the work of a master vampire — and with only two in St. Louis, one being Jean Claude, Anita knows right where to start. Venturing to Jean Claude's Circus of the Damned, Anita is confronted by a group of shape-shifters, a new master vampire named Yasmine and a giant snake that might be a god! It's all-new, high-octane action in this entry into the beloved Anita Blake universe!",
