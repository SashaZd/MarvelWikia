    "description": "The destinies of most people are defined early on.  Then there are the others: The Lost.  Those whose numbers aren’t in yet, who could go toward the light or toward the darkness-indeed, who could be tipped one direction or another.  And everything starts with the book.  That’s what Jonathan discovers when he takes a suicide plunge off the London bridge more than a century ago—and lands in the present.  With the power of the Dark Man behind him—and the help of a cat named Mystery—Jonathan travels to the Lost, revealing their destinies as he discovers his own.  When Jonathan encounters a talented runaway artist, he must help her choose between the easy path and the road less traveled. J. Michael Stracynski (Amazing Spider-Man, Supreme Power) blends timeless fantasy with modern storytelling in this new ongoing series. \r<br>\r<br>32 PGS./T+ SUGGESTED FOR TEENS AND UP …$2.99\r<br>",
