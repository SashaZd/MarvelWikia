    "description": "I, PAPARAZZI: It begins innocently enough with tabloid photos of Reed and Sue on the beach, then Johnny out on the town, and then some rather unkind photos of Ben Grimm devouring every last hot dog and salted pretzel from a street cart vendor, but when the secret laboratories and inner recesses of the Baxter Building start appearing on the cover of the new Superhero Trumpet tabloid, the FF are forced into questioning how and when these photos are being taken. And what do Egghead and his 70 foot tall friend, Gargantua have to do with it? A lot, really. And so do the Invincible Man, Psycho-Man, Basilisk, Cobalt Man, Xeron the Star Slayer, the Terror Birds and a host of other bad guys aiming to take down the World's Greatest Fighting Family by any means necessary! Plus, artist Colleen Coover helps bring you Sue Storm's essay, \"The Importance of Being Invisible.\"\r\nOne-Shot All Ages …$3.99",
