    "description": "He is the last of thirteen, taught for his entire life that he was born better. A Zemo by blood is a superior person. So then why has he always failed? Now, having been sent hurtling through time, Baron Helmut Zemo will have a chance to encounter the truth of his family as it happened in the past -- when he comes face-to-face with the first of his family line, the legendary Baron Harbin Zemo! But how much of what we know of our family history is truth and how much has been embellished by the perspective of time? Can Zemo find a way to escape his situation, or will he choose to stay trapped in time if it means preventing his family lineage from a legacy of failure?
