The Eisner Award-winning team of Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale (DAREDEVIL: YELLOW, SPIDER-MAN: BLUE) continue their insightful look into the early days of Marvel Comics' most popular heroes in HULK: GRAY, unraveling the Hulk's origin — and uncovering a secret that will change the way we look at Bruce Banner forever.
