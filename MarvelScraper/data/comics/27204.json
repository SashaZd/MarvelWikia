    "description": "Collecting six action-packed tales from Wolverine’s mysterious past! First, join Charles Xavier as he journeys deep into Wolverine's mind on a quest for answers that will shed new light on one of the darkest periods of Logan's life — his days in the Weapon X program! It's a brand-new look at the horrifying history of Marvel's most prominent mutant! Next, return to the early days of the all-new, all-different X-Men for new solo adventures of Wolverine and Kitty Pryde. Professor X pairs up green recruit Kitty with the been-everywhere, done-everything vet Logan — and neither of them is all that happy about it. Finally, see what happens when the Power kids go on a field trip to the coolest school on the planet: the Xavier Institute! Collecting WOLVERINE: FIRST CLASS #1-2, WEAPON X: FIRST CLASS #1-3 and WOLVERINE AND POWER PACK #2.\r\nRated A …$14.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-3519-7",
