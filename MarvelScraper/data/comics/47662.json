And when these junior X-Men stand up to the Brotherhood of Mutant Bullies in a murderous game show produced by Mojo and Arcade, will they be outdone by new kids on the block — or will one of their number dissolve back into the neoplasm from which they were formed? Plus: a gallery of Skottie Young’s ever-adorable Marvel NOW! variant covers! Collecting A-BABIES VS. X-BABIES #1, WOLVERINE (1988) #102.5, PINT-SIZED X-BABIES: MURDERAMA and X-BABIES REBORN.",
