    "description": "\"The gods fall, you ascend.\" These simple words — whispered by the Norn Witches into the ear of Loki, the Norse trickster god — would set the world aflame! Loki has always been the consummate outsider, not as beautiful or favored as the other Asgardians. But did it have to be that way? Is Loki evil by choice — or by destiny? Find out as he undergoes his most wrenching ordeals — with epic results. Will Loki kill Balder, the Asgardian God of Light, in fulfillment of the Norn Witches' prophecy? Will he dare tempt the power of Thor, God of Thunder? And will he bring about Ragnarok, the dreaded Twilight of the Gods, in a quest for power? Loki is capable of great evil. Can even fabled Asgard prevail against his treachery — and his destiny? Collecting LOKI (2010) #1-4.",
