He’s certainly up to something when he kidnaps Franklin and offers him to Mephisto! And when Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman take a leave of absence, the old order changeth as the Torch’s ex-flame Crystal and the new Ms. Marvel join the team — just in time to face down Diablo’s vicious elementals!
