    "description": "Field trip! That’s “field trip” as defined in the Lee/Kirby dictionary, which means you’d better pack that bag lunch in unstable molecules and buckle up for a trip beyond your wildest imagination! First stop: a visit to the neighbor’s place, Attilan, home of the Inhumans! Second stop: Paris is beautiful in the springtime — but according to the brochure, Latveria’s lovely year round. Then again, the savvy traveler never trusts a Chamber of Commerce run by Doombots. Third stop: Down Under. Way down under in the lair of the Mole Man! Last stop: The Thing takes an intergalactic tour as a gladiator in the Skulls’ slave arena! You’d better make those travel plans today, True Believer — tickets for this trip are guaranteed to sell out! Collecting FANTASTIC FOUR (1961) #82-93 and ANNUAL #7.",
