    "description": "Warbird is on the run, labeled an enemy of Earth as well as the Shi’ar. Now the X-Men must decide whether to help her or bring her in. But what’s the secret of that alien artifact she’s uncovered? Then, in the aftermath of X-Termination, Iceman begins to deal with the aftershocks of his multi-dimensional ordeal. A catastrophic storm has buried much of the northern hemisphere under the deadly weight of snow, creating a kingdom where only one man rules: Bobby Drake. But Bobby’s mind has become fragmented and lost. Who will stop his reign of terror? Plus: Wolverine and Gambit hit the road in a stolen Lamborghini... with an alien stuffed in the teeny tiny trunk! Collecting ASTONISHING X-MEN #57-59 and ASTONISHING X-MEN #62-68.",
