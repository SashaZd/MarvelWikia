    "description": "The life and times of Tony Stark have never been a quiet affair, but the tales coming at you in our latest and greatest Marvel Masterworks collection are going to drive the Golden Avenger to the brink like never before! As if being tethered to one of his oldest foes, The Unicorn, while his life hangs in the balance wasn’t threat enough, Tony Stark finds himself replaced by his own S.H.I.E.L.D. Life Model Decoy. And this doppelganger doesn’t just want to take Stark’s place—he wants to take his life. So it’s Iron Man vs. Iron Man like never before, while a ghost from the past returns in the form of the mysterious and alluring Madame Masque. That’s not all, though! There’s the return of the Titanium Man and the Crimson Dynamo, the tragic loss of a loved one, the continuing saga of Madame Masque’s torment, a story of voodoo horror delineated by EC Comics great, Johnny Craig, and an epic throw down with the Sub-Mariner while Tony Stark looks to get into the movie business—Masterworks one and all!
