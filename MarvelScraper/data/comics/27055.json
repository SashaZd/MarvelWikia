    "description": "Jim Rhodes, former soldier and personal bodyguard to Iron Man, suffers a horrible injury on the battlefield. To survive, the best technicians of Stark Enterprises build him an advanced cybernetic body; with it Rhodes becomes a new type of soldier armed for a new type of conflict — a true War Machine! After stopping mercenaries from using a repurposed Sentinel to slaughter innocents, Rhodes learns that Eaglestar International, a defense contractor headquartered in the war-ravaged land of Aqiria, ordered the attacks. Joined by Parnell Jacobs, a former arms dealer, and Bethany Cabe, head of a secret R&D facility, Rhodes decides that for his next mission, he’ll do what no court in the land will: bring the corrupt conglomorate to justice! But before he can put an end to Eaglestar’s war crimes, Norman Osborn introduces the Dark Avenger known as Ares into the mix! Can even the ultimate weapon of destruction defeat the god of war — or will a deadly experimental virus bring down both warriors by turning a city of civilians into unstoppable killing machines?! Collecting WAR MACHINE #1-5 and material from DARK REIGN: NEW NATION. \r\nRated T  …$15.99",
