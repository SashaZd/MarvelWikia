    "description": "Before he presided over S.H.I.E.L.D., before he ran with the Howling Commandos, Sgt. Nick Fury fought on the blood-stained sands of the Tunisian desert.  When his entire platoon was massacred by General Stephen Barkhorn and his 21st Panzer Division, Fury stumbled off into the desert toward certain death. Instead, he came face to face with his future. Now, Fury and his crew are deep behind enemy lines, surrounded by trigger-happy German soldiers, and, to make matters worse, their assassination mission has failed. According to a captured colonel, their target, General Barkhorn, has apparently departed to betray the Nazi regime—by going after Hitler himself! But is Barkhorn—genius, loyal, courageous Barkhorn—really a turncoat, or have Fury and his company been suckered into killing time while enemy reinforcements secretly close in? \r<br>In this gripping limited series, Garth Ennis (Ghost Rider, Punisher) and Darick Robertson (Punisher: Born) offer a never-before-seen glimpse into the soul of a warrior you only think you know.\r<br>32 PGS./Rated T+ ...$3.50\r<br>",
