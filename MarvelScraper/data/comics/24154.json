For many at the time, Dani, Rahne, Sam, Roberto and Shan weren't just new mutants — they were OUR mutants! And for the next decade, we thrilled along with their exploits as they honed their powers and became bona-fide heroes among the various teams of X-Men. Now, in the wake of X-INFERNUS, the classic lineup of New Mutants is back together again! Join MARVEL SPOTLIGHT as we have a blast covering 25 years of great storytelling and exciting action, and look forward to the lives of our heroes as told by writer Zeb Wells and artist Diogenes Neves. It'll be a New Mutants classic!\r<br>Rated T+ …$2.99\r<br>",
