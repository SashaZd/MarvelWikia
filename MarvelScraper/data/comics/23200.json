    "description": "The Man Without Fear faces his greatest threats yet in his fantastic fifth MASTERWORKS adventure! Matt Murdock has done battle with Marveldom's most maddening villains — but when he meets the Jester for the very first time, the rules change forever. Framing DD for murder, the Jester sets all of New York on a manhunt for the Man Without Fear! But there's another menace looking to push the stakes even higher: Starr Saxon, the mastermind who discovers DD's secret identity! Then comes the all-time Stan Lee/Gene Colan classic, \"Brother, Take My Hand!\" — a story that marked the ever-advancing march of super-hero comics into the social issues of the '60s by tackling the tale of a blinded Vietnam vet finding his way Stateside. It's a no-question classic! There's plenty of action, too, as DD jumps inside the ring to rub knuckles with Captain America, teeters over the city with Stilt Man, teams-up with the Black Panther and all the while struggles to rebuild his relationship with the lovely Karen Page. And as if that wasn't enough, we're rounding it out with the Stan and Gene's Not Brand Echh side-splitter, \"Scaredevil, Defeated by the Evil Electrifico!\" Collecting DAREDEVIL #42-53 and NOT BRAND ECHH #4.\r<br>272 PGS./All Ages ...$54.99\r<br>ISBN: 978-0-7851-3043-7\r<br>",
