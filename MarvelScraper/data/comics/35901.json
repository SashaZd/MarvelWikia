    "description": "The Avengers Academy: exposed to the public? The existence of the school has been kept secret...and the fame-hungry Striker isn't happy about that at all!  But it may be a moot point as the obsessed super-criminal Whirlwind blames Hank Pym for the death of the woman he loved, Janet Van Dyne, and comes seeking revenge on Hank�s inexperienced students, who are out on a field trip! And hey, who's that locking lips with Justice?  All the drama, action and intrigue you can handle, from the new breakout series which WeeklyCrisis.com says has �a solid premise, interesting new characters, and a superb creative team. I look for this comic to be criminally underestimated, but tremendously satisfying.�\r\nRated A �$2.99",
