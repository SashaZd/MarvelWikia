    "description": "Where were you when Captain America died? Perhaps you were listening to the radio or reading the morning paper. Maybe you were surfing the web or on the phone with a friend. You were probably shocked, most likely thinking, \"How could this happen to Cap?” And for a moment, you perhaps thought about all the ways the super soldier meant something to you. Something very real, very abiding. Fallen Son: Death of Captain America follows the reaction of the legendary heroes' best friends and closest comrades as they struggle to work through the emotions stirred by the loss of their ally, and the stages of grief that make them confront the part they may have played in that loss. This is their story. This is Cap’s story. This is our story. The story of a Fallen Son and the world he helped make a better place. Plus, this edition also includes tons of never-before-seen extras! Collecting FALLEN SON: WOLVERINE, AVENGERS, CAPTAIN AMERICA, SPIDER-MAN and IRON MAN; and CAPTAIN AMERICA COMICS #1 plus extras from MARVEL SPOTLIGHT: CAPTAIN AMERICA REMEMBERED and the OFFICIAL HANDBOOK OF THE MARVEL UNIVERSE. \r\nRated T …$29.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4128-0\r\nTrim size: oversized",
