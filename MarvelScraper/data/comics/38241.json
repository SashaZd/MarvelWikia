Weakened and alone, Thor must strike a dangerous bargain with a mortal woman to launch a last-ditch assault on the forces of death and chaos — as his enemies were hoping he would.?Valiant Vikings, grotesque goblins and lascivious ladies — what more could any Thunder God ask for? In THE TRUTH OF HISTORY, Thor embarks on one of his most epic adventures ever when the God of Thunder and his fellow Asgardians visit Midgard's ancient Egypt — and leave behind a startling legacy that will change our world forever! And in THOR ANNUAL #1, Thor finds himself exiled from Asgard. Without his allies at his side, the wounded and isolated God of Thunder discovers time does not heal all wounds — especially when it's the Egyptian pantheon bearing the grudge! Seth! Grog! The enemies from Thor's past have returned, and they're howling for revenge — ready to exploit Thor's misery and finish him off once and for all. Collecting THOR: WOLVES OF THE NORTH, THOR: THE TRUTH OF HISTORY and THOR ANNUAL #1.",
