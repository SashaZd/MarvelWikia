    "description": "The Children of the Atom are back in their classic adventures from the Silver Age! Launched by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the X-Men blended super-hero action, teen angst, and a metaphor for the turbulent social and racial issues of the ’60s into one potent package!  After laying the foundation for what would become comics’ biggest franchise, Stan and Jack passed the headmaster’s role of the Xavier School to Roy Thomas and Werner Roth, who would come into their own while crafting the tales of Marvel’s merry mutants. Collected in this second amazing MASTERWORKS volume, you’ll find the first appearance of the unstoppable Juggernaut, the cosmic Stranger, the mutant Mimic, and in a classic three-part saga, the mutant-hunting robot Sentinels. And for good measure we’re topping it off with the return of Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil mutants and a two-part tale featuring Lucifer, the early nemesis of Professor X. They’re mutant milestones one and all! Collecting THE X-MEN #11-21.\r\nAll Ages …$24.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-3701-6",
