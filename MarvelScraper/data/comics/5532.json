The lives of the Fantastic Four and the Avengers were saved only when Franklin Richards created a parallel universe, where we found those heroes, reborn! But this world has long since merged back into our own, and the evil Onslaught—forged from the most vile parts of Magneto’s and Professor X’s psyches—has been presumed long dead... but now he, himself, is reborn—and he’s bringing fragments of the other universe with him! Join comics superstars Jeph Loeb and Rob Liefeld in this no-holds-barred, all-out action extravaganza—celebrating the 10th Anniversary of the event that changed Marvel history—as Onslaught, the Marvel Universe, and the Heroes Reborn Universe collide in this massive crossover!
