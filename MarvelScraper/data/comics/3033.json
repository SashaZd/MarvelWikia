    "description": "A true Collector’s Item celebrating one of the greatest events in comics history – the marriage of Reed Richards and Sue Storm! Hard to believe they tied the knot 40 years ago... and it certainly doesn’t seem that much time has passed to Reed and Sue themselves when a special evening out gives them a chance to look over their entire life together – past, present and future – in an all-new 30-page story by Karl Kesel and Drew Johnson. Also included as an added bonus: Reed and Sue’s original 1965 wedding extravaganza, guest-starring the Avengers, X-Men, Spider-Man and a cast of thousands – an epic that could only be told by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby! So, like all great weddings, this Special mixes something old (The original Lee/Kirby FF Wedding Spectacular) with something new (“The Life Fantastic” by Kesel/Johnson) – even though there’s nothing borrowed, and the only thing blue will be any fan who misses this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!\r<br>64 PGS./T+ SUGGESTED FOR TEENS AND UP ...$4.99\r<br>",
