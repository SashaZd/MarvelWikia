But following the suicide of his patient, Bonsaint is finding the curious case of “N.” is plaguing him night and day. He begins exhibiting the same symptoms as “N.”—insomnia, obsessive compulsive tendencies—and finds the questions of \"N.\"s all-consuming condition. But how far down the rabbit hole will he follow his patient…and what monsters lie at the bottom?
