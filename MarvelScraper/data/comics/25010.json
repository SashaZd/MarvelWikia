Between babysitting his out of control trio of Hollywood hotshots, run-ins with the Gestapo, to uncovering the truth about the homegrown roots of an international conspiracy to overthrow the United States government and replace it with a fascist dictatorship, Fortune’s got more than he can handle…and the night is young.\r\nExplicit Content …$3.99",
