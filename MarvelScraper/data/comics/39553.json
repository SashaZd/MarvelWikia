    "description": "Norman Osbornâ€™s memory has returned. The Green Goblin is back. Gwen Stacy is missing. And it will all lead to a confrontation atop the George Washington Bridge whose aftermath will leave Peter Parker, the Amazing Spider-Man, forever changed. Thatâ€™s right itâ€™s theâ€”spoiler warning!â€” death of Gwen Stacy, the story that put a generation into therapy and cemented the Green Goblinâ€™s name as the definition of evil. The Marvel Masterworks present this tragic tale and a host of Spider-Man classics that would come to define the Webspinnerâ€™s world for years to come: the debut of Col. John Jamesonâ€™s werewolf curse, the Man-Wolf. The beginning of Harry Osbornâ€™s descent into madness and suspicion and a certain green costume. The first appearance of Frank Castleâ€”the Punisherâ€”the maybe-villain, maybe-anti-hero who would rise to become one of Marvelâ€™s most famous characters. Topping it off, thereâ€™s first appearance of the nefarious Jackal, the return of the Vulture, Hammerhead, the hilarious Human Torch-built Spider-Mobile, and the shocking wedding of Aunt May and Doctor Octopus! Add to that the debut of fan-favorite Spidey artist Ross Andru and what you have is a Marvel Masterworks! Collecting AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #121-131",
