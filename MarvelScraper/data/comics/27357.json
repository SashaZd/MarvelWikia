For much of his life, Logan’s past has been a mystery, but now, after regaining his memories, Wolverine has more baggage than he can carry. Upon arriving, Logan goes to the center of San Francisco’s legendary Chinatown to resolve a mysterious incident from his past.

As another piece of his violent past is unearthed, the mutant finds himself facing off against the deadly Black Dragon Death Squad.
