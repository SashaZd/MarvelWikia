    "description": "The stories that precipitated PLANET HULK, collected together for the first time! When a doomsday weapon manufactured by Hydra turns up in the Nevada desert, there’s only one man the authorities can ask to go in and defuse it: Bruce Banner! What does all of this have to do with the FF, you ask? Well, who do you think has to deal with the fallout when it all goes terribly wrong? Then, in the wake of recent events, Bruce Banner has finally found a semblance of peace. Here, in the isolated interior of Alaska, he hopes to protect the rest of humanity from the Hulk’s never-ending rampage by secluding himself in self-imposed exile. Banner is confident that his plan will work — after all, who would be foolish enough to actually come looking for the Hulk? But when Nick Fury comes calling, you know there’s trouble for someone involved. It all ends with the Hulk being shot into space\r\nby those he once called allies! Collecting FANTASTIC FOUR #533-535 and INCREDIBLE HULK #88-91.\r\nRated T  …$15.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4377-2",
