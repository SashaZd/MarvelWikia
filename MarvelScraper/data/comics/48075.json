    "description": "1969: The X-Men, Marvel’s poorest-selling title, was in dire need of a shot in the arm. Enter Roy Thomas and Neal Adams, and readers witnessed one of the most amazing evolutions in Marvel history! These two titanic talents threw caution to the wind with sensational stories that brought the X-Men in synch with the thriving youth culture of the late ’60s. Adams’ lavish and dynamic visuals merged with Thomas’ challenging and contemporary stories to create a comic-book series that throbbed with the pulse of the times like none other. Thrill to the introduction of mutant mainstay Havok, the vampiric villain Sauron, the Mutates and Sunfire; battles against the Living Pharaoh and the Sentinels, a classic team-up with Ka-Zar in the Savage Land, and the return of Magneto and Professor X! Collecting X-MEN (1963) #54-66.",
