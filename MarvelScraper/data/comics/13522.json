    "description": "When the Son of Satan is your best option, God help you. New Orleans. The Big Easy. The membrane between our world and the underworld has always been a little thinner here. Now, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the outpouring of human misery has drawn demons like sharks to a bloodbath. What better time for Daimon Hellstrom – a.k.a. the Son of Satan – to pay a visit? It starts with the doctor who delivers a baby that vanishes into the night. A doctor who is devoured by demons wearing New Orleans P.D. badges. Demons who work for someone – or something - -that’s descended on the Big Easy and doesn’t give a damn who Hellstorm or his father is. Something that’s harvesting body parts in a furious race toward unspeakable purposes. This is the Son of Satan as you’ve never seen him before, brought to you by acclaimed novelist Alexander Irvine (The Narrows), with searing art by Russell Braun (Animal Man) and Klaus Janson.  \r<br>Collecting HELLSTORM: SON OF SATAN #1-5.\r<br>120 PGS./Explicit Content …$17.99 \r<br>",
