    "description": "This fall crime noir smacks you right in the face, as award-winning writer Ed Brubaker, whose recent hits on Daredevil, Captain America and the X-Men have made him one of the top writers in the field, joins best-selling Marvel Zombies artist Sean Phillips for CRIMINAL, a new ongoing series from Icon. Navigating through a world of smoky barrooms and double-crosses to present tales of heists, murders and cons, CRIMINAL is determined to be different than any other book on the shelves today.\r<br>In our debut issue, we meet Leo, who can plan the perfect heist... but only if he can be convinced the job is safe enough. See, Leo is not a shoot-first think-later guy; Leo is a professional. But to some criminals, even professionals, the right payout is worth almost any risk. So when an old friend and a crooked cop approach with a plan to seize millions of dollars in contraband from an evidence transport van, Leo must make tough choices, knowing there’s nothing you can trust less in this world than a cop on the take.\r<br>And as a bonus, each issue of Criminal will be packed with material, featuring a full length continuing story, as well as back-up stories and articles about the crime genre in all its forms from the pulps to the modern day.\r<br>32 PGS./No Ads/Mature Content ...$2.99\r<br>",
