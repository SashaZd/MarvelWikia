Jamie Madrox sets up shop in the heart of Mutant Town — but with so many duplicates out in the world, who is the real Madrox? Does he even know anymore? Then, when the fallout from the HOUSE OF M depowers most of the world’s mutants, X-Factor must find answers — fast! With Guido, Wolfsbane, Siryn, M and Rictor by his side — as well as the stuff-knowing Layla Miller — Madrox must take on the manipulative prescient Mr. Tryp’s rival group Singularity Investigations, navigate a superhuman Civil War, learn why the X-Men lied to his team, deal with the unbalanced Quicksilver’s new ability to reboot mutant powers for a price and discover the deadly traitor in X-Factor’s midst! Collecting MADROX #1-5 and X-FACTOR (2006) #1-12.",
