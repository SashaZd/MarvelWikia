Welcome back for another set of gamma-irradiated adventures in the tragic saga of Dr. Bruce Banner and his green-skinned Mr. Hyde, the Incredible Hulk! Stan “The Man” and “Happy” Herb Trimpe have pulled out all the stops for you, and just to make sure the non-stop action doesn’t miss a beat, Roy Thomas joins in to knock it up enough to make your teeth rattle! The Hulk bashes outer-space aliens, smashes the shifting Sandman, grapples with the deadly Mandarin, and faces the return of his earliest, deadliest enemy — the Leader — all the while defending himself against General “Thunderbolt” Ross and the U.S. Army. It’s the Hulk at his absolute most-classic and just in case you had any doubts, we’re rounding it out with bare-fisted battles against the Sub-Mariner, the Inhumans and the bizarre swamp beast, the Glob!
