The good news is that after all these years, Spider-Man finally gets the upper hand on J. Jonah Jameson--but it's gonna cost him, particularly with the all-new Vulture winging into town! Then, Peter drops by Aunt May's house for the shock of his life!  Set your faces to stun! Plus: Spidey's old nemesis THE SPOT returns deadlier than ever! Wait. Did we just use \"The Spot\" and \"deadlier\" in the same sentence? You better believe it! Also, an adventure from Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four's past is about to have a profound effect on their future...that's if Spidey and the Torch can stop fighting long enough to notice!
