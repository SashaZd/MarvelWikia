Dr. Bruce Banner has been presumed dead since his execution, following his murderous rampage through Manhattan as the Hulk. But when reports start cropping up of an unidentified creature appearing around the globe, Nick Fury begins to get worried.

And he’s only too glad to take care of Banner—by any means necessary.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>32 PGS./T+ SUGGESTED FOR TEENS AND UP …$2.99\r<br>",
