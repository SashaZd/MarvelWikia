    "description": "It’s the Ultimate Monster versus the Ultimate Machine in Ultimate Human! All Bruce Banner wanted was a cure. All Tony Stark wanted to do was help. But in typical Ultimate Universe style, human failings and political intrigue get in the way, leading to a primal battle between humanity and technology as the two titanic Ultimates square off in a ferocious test of opposing strengths. It’s a battle between the Hulk, the most awesome emblem of brute force in existence, and Iron Man, whose keenly enhanced physiology represents the bleeding edge of science and technology. And in any such battle, expect massive collateral damage! As the political intrigue and long-buried secrets are slowly revealed in writer Warren Ellis’ own inimitable way, expect to be shocked, surprised and overcome with the kind of seat-of-your-pants, comic-reading glee that is a hallmark of the Ultimate reading experience. Marking artist Cary Nord’s triumphant return to Marvel, ULTIMATE HUMAN is the next key chapter in the ongoing Ultimate saga! \r<br>Collecting ULTIMATE HUMAN #1-4.\r<br>Rated T+ …$15.99\r<br>ISBN: 978-0-7851-2917-2\r<br>",
