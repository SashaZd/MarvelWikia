    "description": "It is the 1950s, the age of the Cold War and nuclear science. Parting the curtain to expose old-world myths and urban legends is showman-scientist and myth buster Dr. Randolph Stein, who embarks on a quest to find the lost explorer Marlowe and disprove the existence of the legendary underwater city of Atlantis. Traveling deep beneath the ocean’s surface on the submarine Plato, Stein is confronted by the growing threat of mutiny within his superstitious crew, and by a series of horrific and unexplainable events that test his resolve and his rational, scientific mind. Nothing can prepare Stein for what he finds — a scene of carnage that suggests the legend of Atlantis just might be true…and that its protector, the dreaded Sub-Mariner, will do anything to prevent its discovery. To survive the awful black waters of the depths, Stein is forced to question everything he stands for. Writer Peter Milligan and painter Esad Ribic bring you the psychological drama of this unknown world, where men go mad and a mysterious man-like figure haunts the depths. Collecting SUB-MARINER: THE DEPTHS #1-5.\r\nParental Advisory …$19.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-3337-7",
