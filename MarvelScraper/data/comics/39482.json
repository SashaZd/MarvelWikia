    "description": "Everyone in Asgard remembers Loki&rsquo;s previous life &mdash; but they&rsquo;re all strangers to him, and fully intend to keep it that way. Desperate, Loki conjures up a mystical means of eavesdropping on their private thoughts &mdash; but what he learns doesn&rsquo;t make him happy. And the lesson may cost him his life! Plus: There&rsquo;s a story bartenders tell about the devil. That at closing time, he chooses a bar and walks in the door. He&rsquo;ll want to talk about his day. If you listen and survive, he&rsquo;ll give you a tip. The story isn&rsquo;t true, but occasionally it amuses Mephisto to play along. And when he&rsquo;s spent the day spying on all the gods and what exactly they&rsquo;re going to do about FEAR ITSELF, you&rsquo;ll want to hear what he has to say. Collecting JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY (1952) #626.1 and #627-631.",
