The group that has returned to earth is finding it much worse than how they left it-- especially underground.  Attacks in the Morlock Tunnels immediately grab the X-Men’s attention. What do these attacks have to do with the future of the mutant race?  Maybe special guest-star Storm can get to the bottom of all this! ",
