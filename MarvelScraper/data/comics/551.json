    "description": "\"BIG THINGS\" PART 1 (OF 2) Who is the new super-villain, Southpaw?  What hold does she have over She-Hulk's law firm?  And just what is the secret behind THE BIG HOUSE, the Marvel Universe's NEW Maximum Security prison for super-powered criminals?  We’re itching to find out, especially since this issue includes dozens of Marvel's best bad guys, including Electro, Sandman, Tiger Shark, Vermin, the Rhino, the Absorbing Man and many more... It's the FIRST multipart story in She-Hulk's new series, and the perfect place to peruse the big green heroine that has all the guys in a tizzy!  And, as the title suggests, it's leading to BIG THINGS!",
