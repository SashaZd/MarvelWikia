Daredevil and the Punisher vie for the soul of Hell’s Kitchen as half the East Coast’s underworld — in chaos since Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin of Crime, was deposed—scramble for a shot at the big chair. And as the city descends into chaos—as murder and intimidation become the staples of the day—Daredevil and the Punisher each seek to restore order in their own unique way. For Daredevil—who’s anointed himself the city’s new “Kingpin”—this means dispensing justice at the end of a billy club. But for the Punisher, justice at the end of a billy club isn’t justice at all. For the Punisher, justice for these animals is at the end of a shotgun. Featuring more Marvel villains than you can shake a stick at—including Hammerhead and the return of the nefarious...Jackal!
