    "description": "Born with the ability to look and sound like anyone, the shapeshifting Mystique is a former pro-mutant terrorist wanted by nearly every government in the world for alleged crimes against humanity. She's used her morphing powers to stand against the X-Men in their battle for mutant-human coexistence for years — but in this increasingly complicated world, Mystique begins to find the battle lines are no longer so clear. In exchange for protection from her countless enemies, Mystique reluctantly agrees to go to work for Professor Charles Xavier, telepathic leader of the X-Men. But instead of being invited to join the team, Mystique is asked to participate in politically sensitive operations as one of Xavier's secret agents, operatives who can't be traced back to Xavier in the event of their capture or death. Can this former mutant-rights terrorist, who can disguise herself as anyone on the planet, be trusted? Collecting MYSTIQUE #1-13.",
