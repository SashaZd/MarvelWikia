The homicidal bank robbers with twitchy trigger fingers are more concerned with their spoils than their survival, and the military doctor who seems to know a bit too much about the undead is acting a bit funny... As greed and survival collide against a horrendous backdrop, a man named Simon Garth just might hold the key to everyone’s survival... The undead continue to walk the Earth in this 4-issue MAX limited series written by Mike Raicht, with art by Kyle Hotz.\r<br>32 PGS./Cardstock Cover/Explicit Content ...$3.99\r<br>",
