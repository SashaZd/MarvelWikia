    "description": "In June, WORLD WAR HULK explodes onto the Marvel scene and SPOTLIGHT is going to be there to cover it - once we make sure our reporters have their life insurance policies updated! The Green-skinned Goliath has returned from Planet Hulk and he wants to pay back the do-gooders who ponied up for that supposedly one-way ticket into outer space! And if there's any collateral damage? Well...it wouldn't be a good issue of MARVEL SPOTLIGHT without that! We'll be talking to HULK creators past and present, pulling back the curtain on the big event of 2007, as well as taking a look back at the classic HULK stories of the past! Armed and ready to deliver the biggest, broadest Hulk coverage out there, we'll be bringing beans, puppies, buckets of industrial strength Gamma-Ray-B-Gone - anything we can think of to protect us against the rampaging man-beast that is the Incredible Hulk! Be there or be scared!\r<br>\r<br>40 PGS./Rated T+ …$2.99 \r<br>",
