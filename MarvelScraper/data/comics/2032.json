Say hello to a pack of New York City gutterpunks, the likes of which the Marvel Universe has never seen!

Wayward angels with dirty faces who, instead of preparing for Magneto's next big assault, must learn to survive in the cold, harsh world of the city that never sleeps. The world of the X-Men is brought to the streets, and the struggle for survival has never been more uncertain…\r<br>Look for MARVEL MUST HAVES: NYX #4-5 next month – and NYX # 6 in July!\r<br>96 PGS./Marvel PSR+ …$4.99\r<br>",
