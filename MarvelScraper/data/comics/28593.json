    "description": "It was 1933, four long years after Wall Street crashed and took the rest of the world with it, and the Great Depression was just getting started. And so was the Goblin. A master at turning hopelessness into a commodity, the corrupt mob boss led a colorful gang of circus sideshow freaks — including the cannibalistic Vulture — in a corrupt stranglehold on the city. Peter Parker came of age during this time of struggle and hardship. Raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, two stemwinding Socialists committed to positive change for the people, Peter would have been a boyish beacon of optimism in any other era. But in this world of noir, he was an embittered, angry young man on the search for justice. And then along came a spider. After a fated meeting with a mystical arachnid and its life-changing bite, he may have just inherited the force to honor the phrase, “If those in power can’t be trusted, it’s the responsibility of the people to remove them.” Collecting SPIDER-MAN NOIR #1-4.\r\nRated T  …$14.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-2923-3\r\nSize: 5-3/4 x 8-7/8 inches",
