A stalwart Avenger, valued member of the FF, savior of the world on more than one occasion, she&#39;s also a killer attorney with a pile of degrees and professional respect. A 7-foot-tall drink of cool, emerald water, she&#39;s tough enough to knock out Galactus with one punch (possibly?) and has a heart bigger than the moon. But juggling cases and kicking bad guy butt is starting to be a little more complicated than she anticipated. With a new practice, a new paralegal and a mounting number of super villains she&#39;s racking up as personal enemies, She Hulk might have bitten off a little more than she can chew&hellip;but she just calls that that Tuesday.",
