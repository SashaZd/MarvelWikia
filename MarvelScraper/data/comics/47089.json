    "description": "The X-Men’s own genetically engineered international super-thief takes center stage in his own MAX miniseries! Sexy secret agents, weird weaponry, vintage champagne and a damsel in distress. It’s everything Fantomex lives for — unless it kills him first! Investigating vicious villains, a kidnapping and the end of the world, Fantomex finds himself at the bottom of the Antarctic ocean, fighting for his life against a deadly Kraken! Meanwhile, EVA gets a new look — and gains a terrible understanding. Can everyone’s favorite faux-French adventurer overcome the lethal government agents of Grover Lane, or will he find this victory to be one thing he can’t steal? It’s all the nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat, uncensored action you could ever want in a comic — and more! Collecting FANTOMEX MAX #1-4.",
