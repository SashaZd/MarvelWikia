Your throat closes, and your chest gets too heavy every time you breathe, and then you know you're doomed. So what if it happened to all the X-Men, all at once? The Sublime are back, and they've unleashed a contagion on Utopia. To what end? Why now? And what's next? Who's left in San Francisco to deal with the Collective Man? Meanwhile, Emma Frost and Sebastian Shaw reminisce over old times — via the strong language of pugilism! Collecting UNCANNY X-MEN #530-534.",
