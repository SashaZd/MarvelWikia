Wolverine may be taking on his roughest mission yet as he tries to kick some sense into Jubilee and boy, does she fight back!  In his version of Upward Bound, X-Men style, he’s hauled her halfway around the world to get her away from whoever or whatever is trying to frame her for mass murder. But this town’s got a problem that’s going to take their combined efforts to combat, and Jubilee’s pursuer is hot on their trail.",
