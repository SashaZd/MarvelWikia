But now, years later, the grandson of the treatment's creator has rediscovered the serum and plans to sell it to the highest bidder. Suddenly, Rogers is confronted with the possibility of a world overrun by Super-Soldiers, in which any despot willing to pony up the cash could have his very own unstoppable army. Can Rogers prevent the formula from changing hands before it's too late? Collecting STEVE ROGERS: SUPER-SOLDIER #1-4 and material from CAPTAIN AMERICA COMICS #1.",
