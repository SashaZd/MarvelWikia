    "description": "Long ago, Storm won leadership of the underground mutant community known as the Morlocks. But her reign was a distant one, and Stormâ€™s neglected subjects grew increasingly embittered. Ultimately, the mad Mikhail Rasputin swept the Morlocks away into another dimension â€” a harsh realm where time ran much faster than normal. There, the next generation of Morlock children came of age, hard and cold and bitter. They returned as a terrorist unit called Gene Nation, and Storm nearly had to slay their leader Storm seeks a new balance in her life. But when she is abducted to Mikhailâ€™s brutal dimension, can Storm prevail against the living reminders of her failure? Or will the sins of her past drag her down? Collecting STORM (1996) #1-4.",
