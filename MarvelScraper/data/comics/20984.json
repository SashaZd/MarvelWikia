Indeed, with Moon Knight fast becoming the poster child for recklessness and brutality, the question of the day is just how he got a Registration Card in the first place!  As Tony Stark's investigation unearths the ugly truth, Marc Spector braces himself for the consequences, unaware that an equally grave threat is preparing to strike.  Carson Knowles -- a.k.a. the Black Spectre -- is back and he wants payback.\r<br>Parental Advisory …$2.99 \r<br>",
