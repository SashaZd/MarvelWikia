    "description": "There is a traitor living among the faithful of Boulder. Harold Lauder, his true nature discovered by the people he once called friends: Stu Redman, Larry Underwood, and, of course, Frannie Goldsmith. They do not know the depths of Harold's depravity, however, nor do they know he has a reluctant accomplice: Nadine Cross. With the pair in deep hiding, danger could be lurking in every corner, but the free Zone Committee has no choice but to carry on business-as-usual. Frannie has a very, very bad feeling, though, and you will too, True Believer, after reading this issue's devastating conclusion!  ",
