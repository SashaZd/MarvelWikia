    "description": "Struck by a ray of energy sent by a dying alien, ordinary high-school student Richard Rider has inherited the mantle of an intergalactic Nova Centurion — and all the headaches that come with it! And even the powers of a human rocket can’t help Richard outrun a rogues’ gallery that includes Zorr, Condor, Powerhouse, Diamondhead, the Corrupter, Megaman — and the dreaded Sphinx, who wants to claim a secret the newly minted Nova doesn’t even know he’s carrying! Can Richard balance schoolwork, a social life and a near-constant string of arch-villains? And if not, which will he lose first — his dreams or his life? Guest-starring Spider-Man in an amazing two-part murder mystery! Collecting NOVA (1976) #1-12 and AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (1963) #171.",
