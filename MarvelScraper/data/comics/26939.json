    "description": "The end is nigh! Last chance to see the Ultimate Universe before everything changes forever! As Ultimatum inexorably approaches, the majority of the Ultimate Universe remains blissfully unaware of the coming darkness. Join us now for a last tour round those fleeting, precious moments. The Fantastic Four and X-Men learn that it is not just the past that can come back to haunt you, as they confront the future world Ultimatum may bring about. Captain America discovers how his legacy has been shamefully abused as he learns the origin of the Black Panther, while the world’s most unlikely duo — the Hulk and the Squadron Supreme’s Zarda — team up for a road trip. And Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson face a momentous decision that could take their relationship to a new level, or end it forever.
