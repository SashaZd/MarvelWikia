The membrane between our world and the underworld has always been a little thinner here.  Now, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the outpouring of human misery has drawn demons like sharks to a bloodbath.  Demons who work for someone--or something--that’s harvesting body parts in a furious race toward unspeakable purposes.  For Daimon Hellstorm, this means one thing: It’s hunting season.  Like Sun Tzu said, “Some battles can be won without firing a single arrow.  All you need to do is sow chaos.”  And who better to do that than the Son of Satan?\r<br>This is the Son of Satan as you’ve never seen him before, brought to you by acclaimed novelist Alexander Irvine (The Narrows), with searing art by Russell Braun (Animal Man) and Klaus Janson.\r<br>32 PGS./Cardstock Cover/Explicit Content ...$3.99\r<br>",
