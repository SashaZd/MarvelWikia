At the heart of the ruins, around the neck of the Doge lies the Arken jewel — the symbol of his lineage. He who wears it will, in turn, inherit the throne. Looters, mercenaries, heirs — many hope to get their hands on precious jewel. Among them, two Dragon Knights and their apprentice! However, their journey and their intentions differ from the others who seek the jewel. But their alliance is fragile and the Palace ruins shelter strange creatures who wish to tear them apart. Is the dangerous dragon really dead and what new monsters has the Veil created?\r\nMature …$5.99",
