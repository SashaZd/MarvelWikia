You’ll be treated to dozens of tales from the dark side by such luminaries as Bill Everett, Gene Colan, Bernie Krigstein, Jerry Robinson and many, many more as they dig up the deepest, darkest tales of suspense and terror found anywhere this side of a mortuary. The Farmer takes a life, but what price will he pay when the chickens come home to roost? Is O’Malley’s friend really the kind of guy you want to hang out with? Find out what makes even a monster afraid, and discover the sure-fire solution to father-in-law trouble! The 1950s were a time of gruesome stories and great art, and Stan Lee’s Atlas had it all.
