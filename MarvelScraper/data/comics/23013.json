    "description": "Marvel’s two deadliest fighters go head-to-head in a battle to the finish! Two men, both products of the Weapon X program, both highly trained killers. One claims to be the best he is at what he does, though what he does isn’t very nice — but the other is the Merc with a Mouth, and he might just have something to say about that claim! It’s Deadpool vs. Wolverine, no quarter asked or given! But when both men can regenerate virtually any wound in a matter of moments, just how does either man expect to finish off his foe? And whoever wins will have to face down Daken, Wolverine’s murderous son, who has a healing factor and aptitude for killing to match them both! Collecting WOLVERINE: ORIGINS #21-27.\r<br>Parental Advisory …$19.99\r<br>",
