    "description": "The Avengers--once assembled, few enemies could ever overcome their combined might. But how did five fledgling heroes form such a legendary group? Learn how the team dealt with the Masters of Evil, Kang the Conqueror and more. Then, the Avengers&rsquo; roster fills out with hot-tempered archer Hawkeye, troubled lovers Goliath and Wasp, mysterious warrior monarch Black Panther, and the team&rsquo;s strange new android recruit, the Vision. With the Panther juggling his kingly duties, Vision striving for public acceptance and overtaxed team leader Goliath quietly descending into madness, could these heroes stay together long enough to defeat the agents of AIM, the Circus of Crime and the Super-Adaptoid? Paying reverence to the original Avengers mythos, Joe Casey and artists Scott Kolins and Will Rosado reveal new stories of the group&rsquo;s earliest trials and triumphs, presented in a thoroughly modern light.",
