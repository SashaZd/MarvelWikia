    "description": "What?  You didn’t actually think that a load of buckshot to the chest in shark-infested waters was gonna put him down for good, did you?  The Punisher’s wildest foe is back -- give or take a few boy parts -- this time he’s embarking on a solo mission: playing bodyguard to the son of a dangerous mob boss.  Should be a breeze for a guy who went toe-to-toe with Frank Castle and lived to tell about it, right?  Guess again.  Junior is a hemophiliac -- and every crime syndicate in the country can’t wait to take a shot at him as payback to his dad.  To survive, Barracuda will have to navigate hitmen, corrupt cops, black ops, a Central American strongman, and rescue a damsel in distress.  No kidding.\r<br>32 PGS./Explicit Content …$3.99\r<br>",
