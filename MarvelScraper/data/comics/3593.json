And if that wasn’t bad enough, Cyclops and Marvel Girl are missing, and their friends’ minds are falling apart as they search for them. One long-time member of the X-Men has uncovered the secret, though—but will he arrive at the Institute in time to save his friends? Ed Brubaker and Trevor Hairsine ratchet up the suspense in this X-Men event, which also features a bonus back-up tale introducing a new mutant, written by Brubaker and drawn by Pete Woods.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>32 PGS./T+ SUGGESTED FOR TEENS AND UP …$3.50\r<br>\r<br>"
