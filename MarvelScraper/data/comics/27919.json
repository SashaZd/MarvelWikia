As the Sakaarian survivors struggle to carry on, the Son of Hulk has only one goal in mind: revenge.

The Son of Hulk will claim his vengeance, even if it means laying waste to an innocent populace to do it.  But even if he can bend this planet under his will, can he possibly become a match for Galactus, the devourer of worlds? \r\nParental Advisory …$2.99",
