    "description": "Stan and Jack are back with another classic FANTASTIC FOUR collection, earning the title “World’s Greatest Comic Magazine” and throwing in a little extra to boot! It all starts off with the origin of that epitome of evil, Dr. Doom. Find out how Doom’s face was scarred and how Reed Richards is connected with that fateful day. Witness the birth of an evil quartet to rival the FF—the Frightful Four! Join the Battle of the Baxter Building as a de-powered FF teams with Daredevil against Dr. Doom in a fight to the finish that’ll loosen your fillings! There’s also monster menaces galore from the Mole Man to Dragon Man and out-of-this-world villains from the shape shifting Skrulls to the undersea warlord Attuma! But it’s not just the panel-bursting action that makes FF great, it’s the personal drama. How will Johnny and Sue respond when the father they thought dead returns? When Reed pops the question will the Invisible Girl say, “Yes,” or do visions of Namor dance in her head? They’re not just classics, one and all, they’re Masterworks! Collecting FANTASTIC FOUR #31-40 & ANNUAL #2\r\nAll Ages …$24.99 \r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4566-0",
