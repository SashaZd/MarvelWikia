The long-awaited sequel to The Hedge Knight tells the story of the adventures of Ser Duncan and his squire one year after their initial meeting at the tournament in Ashford.

But Ser Eustace has another knight in his service who is nothing but trouble, and he will make Dunk’s life far more difficult when he rashly attacks a peasant and causes grief to a local noble, the Lady Rohanne Webber.
