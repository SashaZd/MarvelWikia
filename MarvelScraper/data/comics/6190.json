Consequently, Cobra and Sano Orii are still on the loose and causing mayhem on Chaeyi’s behalf.  With super human venom flooding her body and killing her with each heartbeat, Angela del Toro reaches out to an old, but familiar face---her uncle Hector Ayala, the original White Tiger. Can the mystical amulets cheat the confines of mortality? Or is Hector’s appearance the chilling whisper of imminent fatality? Yet, a new superpower from within her is a cause for hope, but is it enough to overcome death? The light at the end of the tunnel is barely flickering…but has the new White’s Tiger’s life already been extinguished? \r<br>32 PGS./Parental Advisory …$2.99\r<br>",
