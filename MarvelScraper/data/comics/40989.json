His face plastered on news broadcasts nationwide, Banner is a man on the run. Hunted by police and a pair of deadly assassins — and aided only by the elusive “Mr. Blue” — will the beleaguered scientist resort to deadly force to escape his pursuers? Plus: What does it feel like to bear the guilt of responsibility for the death and devastation caused by the Hulk? Banner is finally prepared to end it all with a gun at his temple, but the mysterious, gamma-irradiated government operative Doc Samson wants justice for the Hulk’s actions — and he’s not about to let Banner slip away so easily. Collecting INCREDIBLE HULK (2000) #34-39 and STARTLING STORIES: BANNER #1-4.",
