After years of indentured service to a covert military group called Weapon X, Wolverine escaped and joined the X-Men. Now, after a short time away from the X-Men, Wolverine has returned to New York—with a strange strike force armed with sophisticated military technology on his tail. To survive, he is forced to rely on the Big Apple’s own Spider-Man and Daredevil—not to mention a little help from his fellow X-Men! Plus: For years, Professor X has championed the peaceful relationship between mutants and humans. But with racism and paranoia growing, the president decides Xavier—with his mysterious psychic powers and shrouded background—might be the bigger problem. His solution: get the government involved in the mutant-training business. With the help of Emma Frost, the president handpicks a class of “New Mutants” to serve his political agenda. But who is this mysterious Emma Frost and what is her connection to Xavier? Collecting\r\nULTIMATE X-MEN #34-45.\r\nRated T  …$29.99 \r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4923-1",
