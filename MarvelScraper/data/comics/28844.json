    "description": "A mutant nation has been created on UTOPIA, off the coast of California.  But what does that mean to the X-Men? Magneto’s return has stunned the X-Men, but that’s not the only surprise they’re in for as a herd of Predator X’s come hungry for mutant tar tar.  The hits just keep on coming, but can the X-Men, still nursing their wounds from UTOPIA, deal with all this? What about when the island they call home begins to sink and Namor is the only one who can save the day? Plus: Jubilee returns to the X-Men, Gambit has trouble adjusting to life on Utopia, Northstar deals with the distance that island living necessitates and No-Girl has to save all the X-Men from a foe living right under their noses, Magik has banished Anole to Limbo, but why? And when a mystery strikes Utopia, who does Cyclops send to solve it?  DOOP!
