    "description": "As a boy, Kyle Richmond - the man who would one day become Nighthawk - witnessed the senseless murder of his parents. There was no reason for their deaths, no provocation - they were just simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was a traumatic event that has left him scarred for life - and turned him into a hero more feared than the criminals he polices. Now, it’s happening again... but on a much larger scale. The people of Chicago - men, women and children - are dying in the streets, victims of a monster whose thirst for slaughter cannot be quenched, whose soul is a bottomless void and whose scars run even deeper than Nighthawk’s. Long ago, Kyle Richmond looked into the face of madness - now, it’s looking back at him. And it’s flashing a killer smile. Collects SUPREME POWER: NIGHTHAWK #1-6.\r<br>144 PGS./Explicit Content ...$16.99\r<br>",
