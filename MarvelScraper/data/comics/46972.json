    "description": "After solving the mystery of Creed and the plane crash, Logan heads to L.A. — but after living in the past for so long, can he face his future? Logan plants roots in the City of Angels, hoping to lie low and rebuild his life — but a mysterious figure from his forgotten past returns, and refuses to let sleeping dogs lie! Then, Logan starts to turn his life around, using violence only to save lives. But when one of the people he’s saved proves somewhat less than grateful, he may have to rethink his new policy! Logan ventures out into the California desert — but someone is following close behind. Is it a cop? A killer? Or someone even more sinister? It’s murder and mayhem as Logan faces off against a surprising foe with secrets of his own! Collecting WOLVERINE MAX #6-10.",
