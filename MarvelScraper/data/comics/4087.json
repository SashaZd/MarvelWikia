    "description": "There are some stories that change everything. Such stories usually involve a titanic, cosmic battle that threatens to destroy the universe and often claim the lives of popular characters at conveniently-timed dramatic junctures (say, for instance, at the end of issue 3) or return a previously deceased character from the great beyond… usually the last page of issue 4. But the one thing that is never quite explained is why these characters must die only so that they can (if they’re popular enough) return with great fanfare to the hum of exuberant fanboys everywhere. \r<br>\r<br>Truth be told, only Doctor Strange holds the answer to The Great Mystery, and now, a constantly thwarted, dead super-villain called The Pitiful One wants to know it too so that he and his gang of lackey no-goodnicks can return from the dead as well, fame be damned!  \r<br>\r<br>As the Pitiful One closes in on Doctor Strange’s physical form, his deceased minions (Mysterio! Kraven! Miss America! Tike Alicar!) face off against a team of dead heroes including Dead Girl, Ant Man, The Phantom Rider, Mr. Sensitive, and… (begin exuberant humming, fanboys) U-Go Girl! \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>32 PGS./Parental Advisory …$2.99\r<br>",
