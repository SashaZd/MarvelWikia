    "description": "The Black Widow's house of cards is crashing down around her! As one of the world's greatest spies, the Black Window lives in lies and half -truths. Her long career in espionage has spun a web of deceit decades long. Her fellow Avengers and her lover, Captain America, can never know all the blood she has on her hands — even if they wanted to. Although her heroics have redeemed her, she can never escape her past or all the lives she's led. What is the one secret she buries the deepest? Is she hiding something that would destroy everything she's worked for? More important, what will she do to keep it hidden? Collecting BLACK WIDOW #1-5 and material from ENTER THE HEROIC AGE #1.",
