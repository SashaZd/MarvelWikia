    "description": "Before ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN, before NEW AVENGERS, before SECRET INVASION...Brian Bendis was an award-winning cartoonist, and this scathing Hollywood tell-all was one of his best! Entertainment Weekly gave him an A, Hollywood insiders fell all over themselves to praise him, and fans everywhere gave him a thumbs-up for hilarity. Now, for its tenth anniversary, Bendis releases his sold-out miniseries FORTUNE & GLORY in color for the first time — featuring colors by Matt Wilson (Phonogram). Marvel once again at the stupidity of Hollywood producers, and the enthralling mood swings and ego nosedives of a little indie comic-book creator caught up in the maelstrom of the motion picture industry. This deluxe collection features brand-new text pieces by Bendis, and pages and scenes left on the cutting-room floor. Featuring an introduction by Paul Dini.\r\nPARENTAL ADVISORY...$19.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4309-3",
