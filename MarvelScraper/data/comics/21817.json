    "description": "Prepare yourself for a collection of no-holds-barred Spider-Man classics that defined comicdom’s favorite super hero unlike any other! Starting off with the return of one of Spidey’s oldest foes, Doctor Octopus, the two archenemies set into motion a\r<br>gut-wrenching series of events leading to the death of Captain George Stacy. Ally to Spider-Man and father to Peter Parker’s ladylove, Gwen, Captain Stacy’s death marks Spidey for murder and pits the entire city against him. Now with hero, villain and even the man-on-the-street after him, there’s no moment for rest for the ol’ web-slinger as he wriggles his way through threats from the X-Men’s Iceman to the politicking Sam Bullit and former friend the Prowler. And it all leads into one of the landmark moments of Marvel history, the Comics Code defying “drug” issues. There’s no question Stan Lee’s Marvel Comics strove for a relevance that the competition could only dream of – and with AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #96-98, that mission was placed front and center: Peter Parker’s best friend, Harry Osborn, was revealed to be a drug addict. Letting a battle with Spidey’s nemesis, the Green Goblin, take a back seat to the personal drama that scourged the real-life streets of the reader’s world, the Lee/Kane/Romita team set a new standard for the mainstream’s relevance. Stan Lee pens some of his greatest scripts, chock full of edge-of-your-seat drama and up-to-the-moment politics, while the incomparable artistic team-up of John Romita and Gil Kane launches into the most lavishly illustrated and panel-bursting artwork to ever grace the pages of a Marvel comic. There’s no denying it,\r<br>True Believer, these are Masterworks one and all! Collecting THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #88-99.\r<br>All Ages …$54.99 \r<br>\r<br>",
