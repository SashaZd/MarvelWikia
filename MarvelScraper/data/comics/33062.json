Unkillable mercenary, definite weapons expert and swordsman, hopeless romantic, nutjob. But when he's targeting the likes of Hammerhead, leader of the most powerful criminal organization in the world, or Baron Helmut Emmerich Von Zemo, hood-wearing warrior of hate, even an unkillable super-agent may not be enough! You may think you know Deadpool, but you have no idea. Guest-starring Cable, the Taskmaster, and Domino! Collecting DEADPOOL MAX #1-6.",
