    "description": "A dispute over water during a drought started small, with one of the Red Widow’s peasants being cut by one of Ser Eustace’s knights. But that small cut serves to open old wounds from the Blackfyre Rebellion, forcing Ser Duncan to put his ideals of knighthood to the test when he learns a dark secret about his lord, Ser Eustace. But blood must pay for blood, and Dunk has sworn his sword to Ser Eustace regardless of his past transgressions. Now, Dunk must do battle with the Red Widow’s castellan, Ser Lucas Inchfield, as the Sworn Sword rushes toward its bone–crushing conclusion in classic George R.R. Martin style.\r<br>Rated T+ …$2.99 \r<br>",
