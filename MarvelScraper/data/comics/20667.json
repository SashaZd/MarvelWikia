    "description": "The Punisher isn't known for taking prisoners–so what's life like for those rare few that DO survive their run-ins with Frank Castle?  When we last saw The Gibbon, he'd been poisoned and blown up by the Punisher and left to roast alive in a bar full of his D-List cohorts.  And today?  He lives in hiding with a fellow survivor, plotting his revenge against the man that took his life away, every tick of the clock bringing him closer to an inevitable explosion of violence. Fandom has spoken, and it has said \"Gibbon.\"  We listened.  You're welcome.  By Matt Fraction (THE IMMORTAL IRON FIST, THE ORDER, Casanova) and the legendary Howard Chaykin (WOLVERINE, Howard Chaykin's American Flagg!)!\r<br>Parental Advisory …$2.99 \r<br>",
