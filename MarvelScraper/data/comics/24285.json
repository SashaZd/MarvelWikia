    "description": "Marvel’s Amazons are ready to rip, rend, smash, bash, eliminate, annihilate and just plain violate any man, woman or god that dares get in their way. Led by Princess Artume, daughter of the Amazon queen Hippolyta, these Amazons aren’t gonna wimp out when it’s their turn in the ring — or in the boudoir! Amazons are unleashed as Hercules and sidekick Amadeus Cho find themselves unwittingly wound up in Artume’s insidious plot, one that eventually draws in plenty of other Marvel heroes and gods from the pantheon! Love and War is a story full of action and unbridled humor, with Herc just the way you like — no, love — him. Charming, dumb and getting away with it! Collecting INCREDIBLE HERCULES #121-125.\r<br>Rated A …$14.99\r<br>ISBN: 978-0-7851-3246-2\r<br>",
