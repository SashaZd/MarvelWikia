    "description": "Hot on the heels of the smash comic book hit of 1939, Marvel Comics, publisher Martin Goodman called up two companion titles to join his emerging comics line, post-haste. And now, for the first time in 70 years, the Marvel Masterworks bring the last of that trio of titles—Mystic Comics! Chock full of pulp-style men of action, hard-boiled gumshoes, mythical strongmen, undead avengers, and—of course—super heroes, Mystic Comics is a roller-coaster thrill ride back to the earliest days of comic books, when freewheeling writers and artists threw out wild ideas to a public with an insatiable appetite for comics. In this fully restored collection you’ll encounter comics first super-stretching hero—Flexo the Rubber Robot; the hero from beyond the grave—the Blue Blaze; the Dynamic Man, Master Mind Excello, the invisible Dr. Gade, Dakor the Magician, Zara of the Jungle, the Space Rangers, Hercules, the devil-possessed Black Widow, and more! Featuring an in-depth introduction by noted comics and pulp historian Will Murray, this volume is a priceless adventure into the Golden Age of comics! Collecting MYSTIC COMICS #1-4",
