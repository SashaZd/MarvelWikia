    "description": "Meet Mr. Terror – he’s dapper, he’s charming, he owns and operates his own VERY successful business…and, oh yeah, he’s fifteen and a half centuries old and rotting fast. Doomed to decompose for all eternity, Terror forever replaces his festering limbs with fresh parts. The curse keeps him alive, but it’s what’s left of his twelfth-century sweetheart – encased in enchanted metal and serving as his right arm – that keeps him honest. Today, Terror runs a high-stakes private eye firm – espionage, investigations and assassinations for the extremely rich and extremely powerful. But after eliminating who he was told was a very bad guy, with extreme prejudice and in his own inimitable idiom, Terror learns he’s been had – he’s just murdered a major government intelligence chief. Now, with the feds on his rancid tail and whoever set him up looking to tie their loose ends, Terror’s on the run to clear his name and bring down the real bad guys. But the killers know exactly who they’re dealing with, and they aren’t making it easy for him… Don’t miss this 5-issue series of blood, guts, sex and salvation written by David Lapham (Stray Bullets) with jaw-dropping art by Patrick Zircher (CABLE & DEADPOOL).
