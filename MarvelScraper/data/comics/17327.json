    "description": "This deluxe hardcover collects ULTIMATE FANTASTIC FOUR VOL. 7: GOD WAR TPB and ULTIMATE FANTASTIC FOUR VOL. 8: DEVILS TPB! In GOD WAR, the Fantastic Four find themselves stranded in another dimension, hunted by the warriors from the dread world of Acheron – and its ruler, Thanos, won’t rest until he possesses the one weapon which will give him dominion over the entire cosmos: the mind of young Reed Richards! In DEVILS, meet the alchemist supreme: Ultimate Diablo! The Fantastic Four are pulled into a madman’s scheme when those closest to them are drawn back through time...and when the team follows the trail to the year 1483, they find themselves face-to-face with a man on a quest to transform the world – literally. Plus: Something strange has happened at Nursery Two, the Baxter Building’s Think Tank counterpart in Oregon. It’s disappeared, seemingly swallowed up by the earth itself! And if you think that heralds the return of the macabre Mole Man – go to the head of the class! And finally, Cerebro has been stolen – and the trail points directly at the government’s premier think tank, the Baxter Building! The X-Men aren’t happy about it — and the Baxter Building’s most famous residents, the Fantastic Four, aren’t happy about an angry team of mutants showing up on their doorstep! It’s FF versus X-Men in an all-star blowout! Collecting ULTIMATE FANTASTIC FOUR #33-41 and ANNUAL #2, ULTIMATE FANTASTIC FOUR/X-MEN, and ULTIMATE X-MEN/FANTASTIC FOUR.\r<br>Rated A …$29.99\r<br>",
