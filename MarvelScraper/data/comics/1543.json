Three months in the lives of the 82nd Airborne in the Battle for Iraq are chronicled in this groundbreaking series by long-time embedded journalist Karl Zinsmeister (\"Boots on the Ground: A Month with the 82nd Airborne in the Battle for Iraq\") and penciler Dan Jurgens (Thor, Superman).  In chapter one, \"Paratroopers Over The Border,\" American paratroopers in northern Kuwait must contend with choking sandstorms, high-adrenaline training, and the hair-trigger tension that dominates the tense run-up to war in Iraq.  War arrives in deadly fashion on their doorstep – in the shape of ballistic missiles.  To survive, they must rely on the skills of men whom they’ve never met, but whose fates are inexorably linked to their own.  ",
