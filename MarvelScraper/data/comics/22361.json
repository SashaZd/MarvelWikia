In WORLD WAR HULK #3, the insane Smashfest that is \"World War Hulk\" continues!

And who will survive when the Hulk's best friend on Earth clashes with the Hulk's first ally from Sakaar?

The Hulk takes center stage with a terrifying confrontation and a stunning revelation that lays bare the central question of whether the Hulk is a hero — or a monster.\r<br>Rated T+ …$4.99\r<br>",
