    "description": "In the aftermath of the “Messiah Complex” war, Cyclops took a leap of faith and allowed his son Cable to disappear into the time stream with the first new mutant birth since “M” day -- and the future of the dwindling mutant population -- tucked under his arm. Weeks later, he still waits for a sign, however small, that he made the right decision. When Bishop travels back to the present in search of intel that will aid his search for Cable and the mutant baby, he’sintercepted by the X-Force!  With Cyclops eagerly waiting to interrogate his former comrade, it would appear that the game is over for the time-traveling cop.  So why is Bishop smiling?  Plus, If you think it’s tough being Cable, hopping through time with a bawling kid strapped to your chest, try stepping into Bishop’s shoes for a while. Yeah, you’re a tough, smart cop, and you’re no stranger to tracking time-traveling perps, but Cable is a new kind of quarry. Not only is he an X-Man who’s very familiar with the future, he’s also a highly-trained soldier who knows how to cover his tracks and leave dozens of down-and-dirty traps in his wake.  For you, the stakes have never been higher. Collecting CABLE #6-10 and KING-SIZED CABLE.\r<br>Rated T+ …$19.99\r<br>ISBN: 978-0-7851-3391-9\r<br>Trim size: standard\r<br>",
