    "description": "Getting through high school is hard enough without having to watch your back the whole time, but magic can give you a real edge over the competition.  When fifteen-year-old Kim Vesco moves from Chicago to Salem, MA, she finds that the local student body is divided into rival factions of witches and non-witches, with both sides bidding for her allegiance.  And if that weren't enough, an unknown force seems to want her...dead!  Between the tribal loyalties of the schoolyard and the brutal, fight-or-die logic of the mage-war, Kim has to steer a course that will keep her alive until she can take the fight back to her enemy and reveal the true identity of someone she thought she already knew: herself.\r<br>32 PGS./MARVEL PSR …$2.99\r<br>",
