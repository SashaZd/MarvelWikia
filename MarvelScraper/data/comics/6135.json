Well...their identities are already public knowledge – and they sure can get good publicity by hunting down renegade heroes, so...time for the T-Bolts to kick some spandex butt! Plus: Zemo and Songbird? When did that happen? A new base, a new mission statement, and a new outlook face the no-longer-new Thunderbolts! But why have so many Thunderbolts agreed to Zemo’s plans?

We’re thinking, yes...but wait until you see whose hands our fate does lie in! Collecting THUNDERBOLTS #101-105.\r<br>120 PGS./Rated A …$13.99\r<br>",
