    "description": "The uncanny Inhumans come to the MARVEL MASTERWORKS at last! In 1965, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby gave a strange family of outcasts their debut in the pages of Fantastic Four. Responding to their Shakespearean pathos and Kirby's out of this world character designs, the fans loved them—and wanted more! The mysterious origins of Black Bolt, Medusa, Gorgon, Triton, Karnak and the rest of their wondrous, secret world was initially revealed in a series of Thor features. But that only whetted reader's appetites—and so came their first headlining series in AMAZING ADVENTURES! Launched by writer/artist Jack Kirby, the new series took the Inhumans to their roots, defending their kingdom against the aggressions of mankind—especially against the ultimate threat of the Mandarin. Then a team with uncanny credentials, Roy Thomas and Neal Adams, took up the crown and sent the Inhumans on a mythical exodus into the world of man. It was a saga exploring the social issues of the era and, of course, topped of with a heavy dose of Inhuman action! Also featuring a rare Medusa and Black Bolt tale from MARVEL SUPER-HEROES and a trio of satirical tales from NOT BRAND ECHH by Stan, Jack and their blushing Bullpen! Collecting THOR #146-152, AMAZING ADVENTURES #1-10, THE AVENGERS #95 & MARVEL SUPER-HEROES #15 with bonus selections from NOT BRAND ECCH #6 & 12.\r\nAll Ages …$54.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4142-6",
