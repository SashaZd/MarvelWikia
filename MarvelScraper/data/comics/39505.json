And now the person who really is that person — Steve Rogers, the former Captain America — is kinda mad. Well, really mad, actually. But that’s OK, because Deadpool is totally gonna fix this. Just like he always does. Plus: Deadpool blowing away vampires — how @#$%ing cool is that?! Wait…he’s not blowing away vampires? He’s protecting vampires? That doesn’t sound cool at all.
