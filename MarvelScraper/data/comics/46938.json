    "description": "The Avengers travel to Wundagore Mountain in search of the deadly secrets hidden in the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver’s childhoods.

Then, the Avengers’ rivalry with meddling Henry Gyrich comes to a head just as the Grey Gargoyle makes his move! Fan-favorite villain the Taskmaster debuts! Immortus returns, but what are his plans for Ms. Marvel? Plus: The mad robot Ultron’s history with Earth’s mightiest heroes is a long and violent one. But this time, how is Iron Man responsible for his return — and how can he be stopped? All this — and Hawkeye gets a job! Guest-starring the Elements of Doom, Inferno and the Yellow Claw! Collecting AVENGERS (1963) #185-206 and ANNUAL #9, and material from TALES TO ASTONISH (1979) #12.",
