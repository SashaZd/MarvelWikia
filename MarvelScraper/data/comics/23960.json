    "description": "Hawkeye needs a date for an Avengers picnic, but just once he’d like to meet a regular girl who doesn’t punch holes through walls or jet off to Saturn for the weekend. But how does one go about meeting a normal girl when living the life of a super hero? The solution seems to be an online dating service called Lover’s Leap, but when Hawkeye accidentally downloads a wealth of sensitive Avengers information onto the website, which (dang!) turns out to be a scam site run by Batroc the Leaper, it’s going to take the combined fighting might of the Avengers to get Hawkeye out of this jam! Well, at least some of the Avengers. Please don’t tell the others about this, okay?\r<br>All Ages …$2.99\r<br>",
