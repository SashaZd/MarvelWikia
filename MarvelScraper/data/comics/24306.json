    "description": "Barracuda's back. The most dangerous foe the Punisher has ever faced has found a chink in his enemy's armor, one even Frank Castle himself doesn't know about. Heart full of blackest hate and loving every minute of it, he's out to crush the vigilante to pulp – and take his time over killing what remains. But Castle has a lifetime of slaughter behind him, and who knows how lethal he might yet become? Then, watch as Garth Ennis concludes his seminal run on Punisher in style. Thirty-five years ago, the Fifth Cavalry disgorged their troops on an isolated Vietnamese hilltop and was met by a scene of utter devastation. The final body count ran to well over seven-hundred — almost two-hundred of them American soldiers. Standing alone amidst the carnage, a sole survivor: Captain Frank Castle. Now, the Punisher is about to face his stiffest test: He’s hunted big game in his day, but none as big as this. Five men with unlimited resources. Men who’d put anything between themselves and the Punisher’s bullet. Men who know exactly who he is — and how to fight him. Collecting PUNISHER #50-60.\r\nExplicit Content …$34.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-3782-5\r\nTrim size: oversized",
