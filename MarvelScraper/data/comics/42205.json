Who will get an invitation to the most lavish celebration ever known, the birthday party of Ozma of Oz? And how will Dorothy and the Shaggy Man get through the Deadly Desert, when the cannibalistic Scoodlers want to cook them for soup? Johnny Dooit has an idea — and if he’s right, they all might just survive to learn the origin of the road to Oz! Eric Shanower and Skottie Young deliver another Oz adaptation that’s an instant classic! Collecting ROAD TO OZ #1-6.",
