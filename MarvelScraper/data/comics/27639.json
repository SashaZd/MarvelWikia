But will these dreams also reveal hidden secrets about what she saw and did on the day Steve died? Also, Bucky Barnes is the new Captain America now...but today he's trapped in the past, because today is Bucky Barnes' birthday.  See Bucky's favorite and least favorite birthdays - from the cold winters of the Depression on military bases, to the front lines of WW2, to his new mission as Cap.
