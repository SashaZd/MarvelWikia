Face it, Peter Parker — you just hit the Big Time! But just when things are looking amazing for ol' Spidey, along comes the Hobgoblin to raise a little ruckus. With Norman Osborn in the pokey, there's a giant-sized Goblin power vacuum — one Roderick Kingsley is more than willing and able to fill! And facing the threat of the newly revived Hobgoblin will take all of Spidey's resolve — and probably a new costume, to boot! It's a new status quo in the life, love and adventures of Peter Parker and Spider-Man — guest-starring the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, and a cavalcade of Spidey's greatest friends and foes!Collecting AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (1963) #648-651.",
