If this collection of octane-infused stories by some of comics’ hottest talent doesn’t make you want to genuflect at the Altar of Wade, nothing will. Thrill as the Merc with a Mouth squares off against probe-happy aliens, trigger-happy mimes and one seriously unhappy fanman – and that’s just half the book!  Wince as Wade bares his soul (and lots more) to a shrink who’s got major squirrels in his own attic.  Thrill as he travels around the globe and then some to settle a childhood bet.  And chill as C.S.I. investigators at a blood-splattered crime scene attempt to piece together why this particular “unsub” needed battery cables, Crisco oil, three stacks of adult magazines and a live chicken to pull off the hit.\r\nParental Advisory …$4.99",
