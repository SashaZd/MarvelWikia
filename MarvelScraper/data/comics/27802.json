Wade, the severed Zombie Deadpool head and Dr. Betty find themselves back on good old Earth, knee-deep in swampy goodness.  Seems like Headpool is a little homesick, and everyone agrees the zombie virus should be put safely back into its own dimension.  All they’ve got to do is find that damn dimensional portal.  Anyway, you don't think A.I.M, is gonna give up that easy, do you?  No way.  Just because their space station got itself all blown up doesn't mean they're out of the game.  But wait -- who's this surprise guest star?  Is it a MAN?  Is it a THING?  Well, you see where this is going ... Is this enough preview copy to get you to buy the damn book…because I can go on all night?!\r\nParental Advisory …$2.99",
