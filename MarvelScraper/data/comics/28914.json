    "description": "A son of privilege. A son of prestige. And a total basket case. From Harry Osborn’s youngest days, he has lived in the shadows of a powerful and narcissistic father. Always seeking approval that never came. Always hiding in the corners of shame. Always being reminded that, no matter what he did, he could never measure up — a fact of life made even worse when what you need to measure up to is the on-again, off-again insanity of the Green Goblin! But now, it’s time for Harry Osborn to become the son his dad always wanted him to be, to take the responsibility of being an Osborn seriously. It is time to step into the armor of the American Son and fight for what is right. And what is right is always what Norman wants. Papa has never been prouder — but will Harry, Peter Parker or anyone else around them be able to live with his choice?
