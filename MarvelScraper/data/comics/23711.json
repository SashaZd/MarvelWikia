    "description": "Peter Parker and his Aunt May have perhaps the most important conversation of the young web-slinger’s life. It’s a gut-wrenching, emotional roller coaster you’ll never forget. And Spider-Man is on the call when there is a huge explosion in the side of the Triskelion — the high-tech site housing superhuman criminals. From the acrid smoke emerges a man seething with vengeance — a man who wants Peter Parker dead! That man is Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin! And for the web-spinner, things are about to get out of control! Then, things are changing in the young life of Peter Parker: the Fantastic Four’s Johnny Storm is now his buddy — and the hot—headed super hero has taken a liking to Peter’s classmate, Liz Allen! But something is horribly wrong with Liz — something that will soon affect the life of every student at Midtown High — including Peter’s ex-girlfriend, Kitty Pryde! Guest-starring the X-Men and the most malevolent mutant of all: Magneto, Master of Magnetism! Plus: The return of Omega Red! And the worst day in Peter Parker’s life!
