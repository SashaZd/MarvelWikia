Deadpool’s ridiculous team-ups continue as the maniacal Merc with a Mouth partners with some of the Marvel Universe’s most respected characters — and a vampire cow.

Wade takes the world of sports entertainment by storm as he forms a tag team with the Thing, gets caught red-handed raiding the ruins of Asgard by Thor, finds new uses for chopsticks in China with Iron Fist, escapes the clutches of the evil Dr. Kilgore with the help of a bloodsucking bovine, watches the Watcher watching him in the men’s room, loses his job as a herald of Galactus and rocks a Phoenix costume while battling Shi’ar robots with Wolverine! All in all, it’s pretty much everything you’d expect from Deadpool! Collecting DEADPOOL TEAM-UP #888-883 and WOLVERINE/DEADPOOL: THE DECOY",
