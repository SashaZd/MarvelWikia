    "description": "Assembling a team of this talent, this breadth of style and scope, is no easy task. Pouring this much creative ability into a\r\nuniverse as broad and deep as Bungie Studios’ Halo, is no mean feat. Pulling that together into a cohesive graphic novel anthology is a Herculean task, but here it is. The Halo Graphic Novel. Four tales from the Halo universe by some of the finest talent in comic book history, including the central story, “The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor,” with art by Simon Bisley (Slaine, Batman, Judge Dredd) and a story by Lee Hammock. Creator of cult manga Blame! - Tsutomu Nihei - writes and illustrates Sgt. Johnson’s tale, “Breaking Quarantine,” and the trio of Ed Lee, Andrew Robinson and Jay Faerber team up to bring us “Armor Testing,” a story of technology in the 26th century. Last, but not least is “Second Sunrise Over New Mombasa,” from Brett Lewis and legend Jean “Moebius” Giraud.\r\n17 & Up …$19.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-2378-1\r\n©2010 Microsoft Corporation.
