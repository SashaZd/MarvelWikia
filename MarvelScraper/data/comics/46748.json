But this Ghost wonâ€™t be laid to rest until heâ€™s run Wolverine through a gauntlet of Adamantium weapons, killing the mutant maverick with the very metal thatâ€™s saved his life so many times! Unwilling to risk his friends, Wolverine stands alone in a story of intrigue, romance and devastation â€” culminating in a clash between two killers! Collecting WOLVERINE (1988) #119-122.",
