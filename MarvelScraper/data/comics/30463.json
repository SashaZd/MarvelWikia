    "description": "Captain America makes his Silver Screen debut in July, but SPOTLIGHT's got the First Avenger covered in May! We'll get you ready for the movie starring Chris Evans with a bounty of features — including an up-close interview with Edhe man who remade Cap into the comics sensation of the new century! Plus: We'll investigate the Sentinel of Liberty's Ultimate counterpart with Marvel Architect and ULTIMATE CAPTAIN AMERICA writer Jason Aaron, and open up the sketchbook of the one and only Ron Garney! No SPOTLIGHT about Cap would be complete without a look at his time in the Avengers — but we'll one-up that with an in-depth analysis of the Invaders, as well! And that's only the shield-slinging start in a SPOTLIGHT for the ages!",
