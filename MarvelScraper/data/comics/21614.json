    "description": "The reintroduction of a classic, brutal and bloodthirsty Kraven the Hunter! A bank robbery goes violently wrong – leaving the Rhino on the lam, running from the long arm of the law and, of course, the Punisher. As Frank Castle looks to settle the score with an old foe, the Hunter stalks the same prey, building himself the ultimate menagerie – a living, breathing super-human zoo! Add Spider-Man into this mix as the lone voice of sanity, and you've got chocolate and peanut butter with bullets dipped in it. Delicious! Violent! Explodey! Plus: Take a look inside the life and times of two misfits who’ve both been victims of the Punisher. And with WORLD WAR HULK in full swing and New York shut off from the outside world, who's left to protect those left behind? Frank @#$%!@!* Castle, that's who – and he's none too thrilled. As the insatiable Mung the Inconceivable rampages alone through lower Manhattan, Frank and Clarke help a small band of refugees hold back his relentless onslaught.
