    "description": "Legacy isnâ€™t a dirty word, but itâ€™s an irrelevant one. Itâ€™s not important what our parents did. It matters what WE do. Someone has to save the world. Youâ€™re someone. Do the math. The critically acclaimed team of Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie reinvent the teen super-hero comic for the 21st century, uniting Wiccan, Hulkling and Kate â€œHawkeyeâ€ Bishop with Kid Loki, Marvel Boy and Ms. America. No pressure, right? As a figure from Lokiâ€™s past emerges, Wiccan makes a horrible mistake that comes back to bite everyone on their communal posteriors. Fight scenes! Fake IDs! Plentiful feels! (a.k.a. â€œmeaningful emotional character beatsâ€ for people who arenâ€™t on tumblr.) Young Avengers is as NOW! as the air in your lungs and twice as vital. Hyperbole is the BEST! THING! EVER! Collecting YOUNG AVENGERS (2013) #1-5 and material from MARVEL NOW! POINT ONE #1.",
