    "description": "Carol Danvers, in her super hero identity of Ms. Marvel, struggles daily to be the best hero ever — due in no small part to the inspiration of her legendary mentor and namesake, the original Captain Marvel. But when the deceased hero suddenly reappears, lashing out at the churches made to honor him, Danvers must rise to the occasion to protect her ally’s memory. With the help of some trusted allies, Ms. Marvel also uncovers the involvement of her hated arch-nemesis: the shape-shifting mutant known as Mystique! The two women have a wicked and tangled history, and Danvers is all too eager to sort it out. But how do you track down a woman who could be anyone? And what is Mystique’s roll in the shocking reappearance of the one man Ms. Marvel dare not defeat? Collecting MS. MARVEL #47-50.\r\nRated T  …$14.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4574-5",
