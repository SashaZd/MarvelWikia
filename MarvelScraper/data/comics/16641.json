Peter Parker would love nothing more than to get a good night's sleep, but his sleek, symbiotic suit has plans of its own...and no one is gonna get in its way! Next, Venom is back in town, and he's on a rampage...but it has nothing to do with his vendetta against Spidey? What could be so important that Venom doesn't have the time to torture his nemesis? Peter Parker is determined to find out, but first he'll have to match journalistic wits with none other than Eddie Brock! And finally, remember back in the day, when super heroes would fight other super heroes? What? That still happens? Civil…what? Well, ANYway…we’re taking you back in time, when Spidey was pretty new at all this super hero stuff, and would make silly mistakes, like, oh, say...knocking out the Invisible Girl! I think her friends might want to have a talk with the web-crawler. Plus: backup stories featuring the Lizard and TWO Scorpions!
