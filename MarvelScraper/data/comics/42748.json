    "description": "The team’s mission hits home when they land in the United States of California, birthplace of Kurt Waggoner! What happens if they can’t defeat this Xavier — and what does it mean for Nightcrawler? Then: Meet the X-Treme X-Force as Dazzler is confronted with the person she might turn into if she never gets home! And in the wake of recent events, something is off about Xavier. Will the team be able to close the tears between dimensions without him? Plus: Romance is in the air — or it could be, if Dazzler and Cyclops don’t kill each other first! And when Dazzler and her team find themselves in a war against the Brood, the dimension they land in is strangely familiar. Collecting X-TREME X-MEN #6-7, #7.1 and #8-11.",
