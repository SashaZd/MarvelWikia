    "description": "Experience WORLD WAR HULK – the super-hero-smashing, city-leveling, bone-crushing, Marvel-history-making event – and its major tie-ins in chronological order! Exiled by a group of Marvel \"heroes\" to the savage alien planet of Sakaar, the Hulk raged, bled and conquered – rising from slave to gladiator to king. Now, the Hulk returns to Earth to wreak his terrible vengeance on Iron Man, Reed Richards, Dr. Strange and Black Bolt – and anyone else who gets in the way. Stronger than ever, accompanied by his monstrous Warbound gladiator allies and possessed by the fiercest and purest rage imaginable, the Hulk may just tear this stupid planet in half. The epic story of anger unbound begins in WORLD WAR HULK #1! And in WORLD WAR HULK: FRONTLINE #1, get your street-level view of the Hulk’s invasion! The Green Goliath has returned to Earth on a collision course with some of Marvel’s mightiest heroes…so what does that mean for the ordinary people caught in the crossfire? Ben Urich and Sally Floyd pound the pavement to uncover the story behind the story! Plus: Who wants our tireless reporters to take down J. Jonah Jameson, and how do they want them to do it?\r<br>All Ages …$4.99\r<br>",
