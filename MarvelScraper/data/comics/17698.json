But who are they? Where did they come from?  And what right do they have to call themselves the Young Avengers?  And in FAMILY MATTERS, the newly reconfigured Young Avengers prepare to make their public debut—but first they have to face a threat more powerful than Kang the Conqueror, more dangerous than Mr. Hyde and more cunning than the Masters of Evil: their parents. For these brand-new super heroes, fighting super villains is child's play compared to maintaining their alter egos!

And finally, discover the secret history of the Young Avengers when Jessica Jones and Kat Farrell investigate the kids’ origins for a special issue of The Pulse. Who were they and what were their lives like before they met Iron Lad?
