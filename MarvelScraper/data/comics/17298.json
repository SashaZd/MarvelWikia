From the Venerable Vaults of Marveldom, it's the Mighty Marvel Handbook -- in the style of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s! Just what is a Legacy Handbook, you ask? Imagine a Handbook written during each of those decades. The profiles within each chapter cover everything published by the hallowed House of Ideas up until that point.
