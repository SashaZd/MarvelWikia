The sheriff of this sleepy little town firmly believes he’s found the culprit—a scruffy drifter found sleeping in the bushes with blood on his clothes and no believable explanation for where he was and what he was doing when the murders occurred. He even gave the sheriff a fake name: “Johnny Blaze.”  But the identity of the true culprit is even more macabre: Lucifer has taken up residence in a new host – a casualty of CIVIL WAR who’s bound to raise eyebrows!
