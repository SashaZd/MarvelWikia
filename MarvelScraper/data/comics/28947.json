    "description": "It’s been six months since the Ultimatum Wave laid New York low, and the world according to Peter Parker has a whole new set of rules… The Daily Bugle is no more, the Kingpin has been deposed, Midtown High has another super hero roaming the halls—and would you believe the people of New York City absolutely adore Spider-Man? Even the cops are asking for his autograph! You’d think life for Peter Parker was pretty sweet, but the Ultimate U’s favorite high-schooler has some issues, too: a new girlfriend earning all kinds of drama from the old one, Aunt May turning her modest Forest Hills home into a boarding house for wayward youths and a hot-headed hellion named Mysterio on the loose! And that’s just for starters! Collecting ULTIMATE COMICS SPIDER-MAN #1-6.\r\nRated T  …$19.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4099-3",
