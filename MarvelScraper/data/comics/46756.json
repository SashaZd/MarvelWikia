Who says romance is dead? And when a familiar face hovers between life and death, Monet is the only one who can save them — but it will require reliving the most horrific experience of her life. Finally, X-Factor investigates a series of eerie portents that leads them to a mysterious, previously unknown race of beings called the Warders. Their job? To prepare the world for its end. And it’s closer than X-Factor thinks! Collecting X-FACTOR (1986) #246-249.",
