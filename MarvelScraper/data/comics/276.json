But Xavier can't be everywhere at once. What becomes of a group of young mutants that have to rely on themselves for everything from food to shelter to love? Wayward angels with dirty faces who, instead of preparing for Magneto's next big assault, must learn to survive in the cold, harsh world of the city that never sleeps.  \r\nMarvel’s own Joe Quesada and superstar-in-waiting Josh Middleton bring the world of the X-Men to the streets, and the struggle for survival has never been more uncertain…\r\n32 PGS./MARVEL PSR …$2.99\r\n",
