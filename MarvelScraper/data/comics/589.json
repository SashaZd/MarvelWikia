    "description": "Peter Parker, Matt Murdock & Logan were fated to be heroes. If Peter Parker wasn’t bitten by a radioactive spider would he still do battle with a madman named Norman Osborn?   Matt Murdock, though blinded, had no heightened senses.  Nevertheless, he became a legal champion of the poor in Hell's Kitchen, crossing paths with a powerful crime boss named Wilson Fisk -- the Kingpin.  Logan – still an enigmatic, amnesiac drifter – is on the run from his bloody past, without mutant powers to save him. By re-imagining Marvel’s most popular characters without superhuman powers, this series will strip these heroes to their core, exploring what it means to be a hero in very human terms.",
