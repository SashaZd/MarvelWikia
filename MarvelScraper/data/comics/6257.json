In 2006, Marvel Comics and Dabel Brothers Production republished the book in a prestige hardcover format, much to the delight of collectors and critics alike. And in Spring 2007, the Dabel Brothers will continue the story of THE HEDGE KNIGHT by adapting the next chapter in the series: George R. R. Martin’s THE SWORN SWORD.\r<br>Featuring the return of the creative duo of Mike S.

But the Lady Rohanne has problems of her own…and she knows the truth about Ser Eustace and the side he took in the battle of Redgrass Field. The long-awaited sequel to THE HEDGE KNIGHT has finally arrived!\r<br>32 PGS./ Rated T+…$2.99 \r<br>",
