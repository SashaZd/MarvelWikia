    "description": "Long live Asgard, True Believers! What better way to herald the return of the God of Thunder, than to usher in another Mighty Thor Masterworks! \r<br>After years of honing the tragedy and intrigue of the Son of Odin, Stan and Jack hit a stride that would produce the most mythic tales in all of Marveldom. Beginning with a pair of irredeemable uglies, Replicus and the Super-Skrull, the adventure then takes itself up a Norse notch when the evil Loki conspires to have Thor stripped of his power and vanquished to Earth! Stranded there, he must struggle to survive the machinations of his scheming half-brother, while attemping to regain the graces of All-Father Odin.\r<br>Last, but not least: Enter one of the most beloved baddies in all of the Asgardian entourage—The Wrecker! The decidedly mortal Thor must battle to his very last breath against this crowbar-wielding wingnut, who himself is powered with Asgardian might! And we’ll warn you now, the last note is a tragic one as Thor faces his ladylove, Sif—in the body of the undefeatable Destroyer! \r<br>It’s drama as only the Masters of the Marvel Age can make it! Collecting THOR (Vol. 1) #141-151. \r<br>256 PGS./Rated A …$54.99\r<br>",
