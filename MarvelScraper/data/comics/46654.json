    "description": "The true flagship X-Men series returns! In the wake of the Phoenix event, exactly what are Cyclops and his team of outlaw X-Men: visionary revolutionaries or dangerous terrorists? Whatever the truth, Cyclops, Emma Frost, Magneto and Magik are gathering new mutants and redefining the name “Uncanny X-Men.” But they face harsh challenges: Once again, robotic Sentinels hunt the team and the mutants they protect — but who’s doing the hunting? And there’s a mole on Cyclops’ squad — who is it? A weakened Magneto must prove he’s still the master of magnetism as Magik wonders why she’s the only member of the Phoenix Five to emerge unscathed! Plus: Learn what it’s like to be a student at Cyclops’ new school! Blockbuster creators Brian Michael Bendis and Chris Bachalo revamp the entire X-Men concept! Collecting UNCANNY X-MEN (2013) #1-5.",
