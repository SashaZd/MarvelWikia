    "description": "Former FBI and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jimmy Woo just wants to make the world a better place. As the leader of the secret empire begun by Genghis Khan, Woo wants to use that considerable might and power for good. Yet the real challenge is to assert control over the business side, as the Atlas Foundation is also one of the world’s largest criminal organizations. With the help of his Agents — Gorilla-Man, M-11, the Uranian, Namora and Venus — Woo must battle mysterious threats from deep beneath the sea, a rampaging Hulk and more. But the Atlas Foundation’s greatest threat comes from within: Breathing down Woo’s neck is the vicious, calculating dragon advisor Mr. Lao, who has already selected his master’s replacement: the equally vicious Temugin — the son of the super villain the Mandarin. And as if that wasn’t enough, a dangerous foe with a powerful link to Woo’s past is challenging his underground empire all over the planet. Collecting AGENTS OF ATLAS #6-11.\r\nRated T  …$14.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4031-3",
