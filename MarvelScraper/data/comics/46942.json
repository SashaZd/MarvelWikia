    "description": "Brace yourself for intense action as Wolverine faces down the Wendigo, deals with his deadly new bride Viper, is possessed by a body-hopping fugitive and gets shanghaied into space to save an entire planet from…Galactus?! Back on Earth, Wolverine battles robots; teams up with Nightcrawler, Jubilee and Alpha Flight; and confronts the ever-incredible Hulk — but Logan isn’t quite himself, and there’s a more sinister reason for it than you’d think! It all leads up to the ol’ Canucklehead’s 25th-anniversary bonanza, the twin threats of Apocalypse and Sabretooth, the identity of Death revealed — and the return of a certain unbreakable metal that’s been near and dear to Wolvie since his debut. SNIKT! Guest-starring Ms. Marvel, the Starjammers, Cable, the X-Men, the New Fantastic Four and a horde of Marvel heroes! Collecting WOLVERINE (1988) #129-148 and HULK (1999) #8.",
