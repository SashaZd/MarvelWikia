That’s right: Wade Wilson -- a.k.a. Deadpool!  And while everybody’s excited about Cable bringing Hope back to the present to rejoin the X-Men, they’re forgetting the most important part of the story: The beginning, back when Cable first lifted the helpless baby out of her incubator up in Alaska.  Wait -- You don’t think Cable did that alone, did you?  You don’t think he managed to make his way across hundreds of miles, avoiding Predator X and Purifiers without a little assist, do you?  Hell no. Cable asked for help from his favorite Merc with a Mouth and now, finally, this action-packed, oversized story can be told.  Before there can be an end, there must be a beginning. \r\nRated T  …$3.99",
