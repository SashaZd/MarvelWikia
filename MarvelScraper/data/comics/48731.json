    "description": "They&#39;re the X-Men&#39;s black-ops strike team, created to go places and do things the regular squad can&#39;t or won&#39;t. They&#39;re the best trackers and killers the X-Men have to offer: Wolverine, X-23, Warpath, Wolfsbane, Archangel and more. They&#39;re X-Force. When the Purifiers resurrect some of the most heinous mutant-murderers in history, X-Force launches into battle with claws out and teeth bared. But can they rescue a teammate and put an end to Bastion&#39;s machinations? And when the lethal Legacy virus is stolen, X-Force must take on the Marauders while Warpath hunts down the Demon Bear! But can the team save their friends from the Leper Queen before they literally run out of time? Plus: Wolverine, alone against Hydra! Collecting X-FORCE (2008) #1-13, X-FORCE SPECIAL: AIN&#39;T NO DOG #1, and material from X-FORCE ANNUAL (2010) #1.",
