    "description": "Long ago, Kyle Richmond looked into the face of madness – now, it's looking back at him. As a boy, Richmond – the man who would one day become Nighthawk – witnessed the senseless murder of his parents. There was no reason for their deaths, no provocation – they were just simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was a traumatic event that has left him scarred for life – and turned him into a hero more feared than the criminals he polices. Now, it's happening again...but on a much larger scale. The people of Chicago – men, women and children – are dying in the streets, victims of a monster whose thirst for slaughter cannot be quenched, whose soul is a bottomless void and whose scars run even deeper than Nighthawk's.\r\nAnd it's flashing a killer smile. Collecting SUPREME POWER: NIGHTHAWK #1-6.\r\nParental Advisory …$24.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-3775-7\r\nTrim size: standard",
