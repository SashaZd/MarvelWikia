In one bold stroke, writer Grant Morrison (All-Star Superman, Batman) propelled the X-Men into the 21st century — masterminding a challenging new direction for Marvel’s mutant heroes that began with the destruction of Genosha and never let up.

Now, his entire Eisner Award-nominated run on NEW X-MEN is collected across three titanic trade paperbacks! Collecting NEW X-MEN #142-154.\r<br>Rated T+ …$34.99 \r<br>ISBN: 978-0-7851-3253-0\r<br>",
