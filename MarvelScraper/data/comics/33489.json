    "description": "It is 1935 and a popular radio show tells the story of the New York City night. How the unstoppable, unyielding, merciless force of nature named the Punisher seeks to drive a stake into the heart of the city’s underworld. How this juggernaut of vigilante violence has mob boss Dutch Schultz squirming — and calling in big guns like Barracuda and Jigsaw to stop him. How the cycle of violence has not only claimed the lives of a prodigious amount of mobsters, but the souls of a small-time grocer and his impressionable young boy. But it’s not just a radio show. In New York City, in 1935, it’s also very real. And God help you if you get on the wrong side of the Punisher. Collecting PUNISHER NOIR #1-4.\r\nParental Advisory …$14.99",
