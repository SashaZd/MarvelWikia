Uncle Henry, Aunt Em and Dorothy must leave their Kansas home — but where can they go? To Oz, of course! Dorothy and the Wizard take Em and Henry on a grand tour — but will anyone in Oz be left alive after the Nomes attack, allied with the disagreeable Growleywogs and the evil shape-shifting Phanfasms? Ozma discovers the Nome Army’s impending invasion, but too late — and she, Dorothy, the Tin Woodman and the rest of their friends can only watch helplessly as the Nome King’s hordes pour into the Emerald City. But the Scarecrow has a plan to save the day, and Glinda the Good has another! Can they rescue the Land of Oz from destruction? Collecting EMERALD CITY OF OZ #1-5.",
