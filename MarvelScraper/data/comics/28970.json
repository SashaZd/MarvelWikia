    "description": "Nowhere is safe. After leaving their home in San Francisco and relocating to the floating island of Utopia, the X-Men finally thought they were safe. But though they were free from the persecution of Norman Osborn’s corrupt peacekeeping organization H.A.M.M.E.R., the mutants would have very little time to build their new nation before finding themselves under attack once again. A murderous foe from the X-Men’s past, Emplate is not simply content to torment his enemies: He must feast on their mutant bone marrow to survive. After catching the X-Men by surprise and attacking them in their new home, the vampiric mutant kidnapped one of the team’s students, the mutant known as Bling! Now, with Bling! held captive in Emplate’s own twisted dimension, the X-Men will go to any lengths to save the young mutant before the villain devours her. As the team’s scientists struggle to find a way to breach the dimensional rift, Rogue steps forward with a plan to make her way into Emplate’s dark home. But will she be quick enough to save Bling! and return her to Utopia? Collecting X-MEN: LEGACY #228-230 and X-MEN LEGACY ANNUAL.\r\nRated A …$14.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4115-0",
