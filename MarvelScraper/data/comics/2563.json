Plus, two SPECTACULAR stand-alone stories! First up: Ben Grimm's all-night poker games have become legendary among the super-hero set, and for the first time Spider-Man has been asked to join the table! But when the Kingpin unexpectedly deals himself in, the stakes are raised! Can the wall-crawler come out on top in this celebrity poker showdown? Then: Once he was the Mindworm, arch-nemesis of Spider-Man! But now he's a lonely, forlorn beggar, trapped in an infernal triangle of poverty, booze and dementia. How can Peter Parker help his one-time foe --and is Spidey himself responsible for his pitiable condition? And finally, from the pages of PETER PARKER: SPIDER-MAN, witness the return of Dr. Octopus in an intense three-part saga!
