Desperately seeking a means to destroy the pilfered artifact that’s cursed him, Gambit journeys deep into the Guatemalan jungles in search of a lost temple — but finds an ancient god-monster accidentally loosed on Earth! It’s going to take more than just playing cards and southern charm to get out of this one! Then, coerced by a criminal mastermind, Gambit is sent to the United Kingdom to heist the greatest weapon in the history of man: Excalibur! Can the ragin’ Cajun dupe his extortionist while also escaping with a clear name? Or will Pete Wisdom and MI13 find him first? Collecting GAMBIT (2012) #1-7.",
