    "description": "The birth of a single mutant child forever changed the landscape of the X-Universe. Some see the baby as the last hope for mutankind’s survival; others see it as the bringer of the Apocalypse… No one knows which side is right because Cyclops handed the newborn over to Cable, believing his son could save both the child and mutantkind. But Cable never came back. Now, months later, Cyclops has found his son hiding in the FUTURE... and he’s sending in the one team that will do what needs to be done in order to ensure the survival of their species... X-FORCE. The X-Men event of the decade, “MESSIAH COMPLEX,” continues here as the past, present and future converge in the pages of X-FORCE and CABLE. Continues next month in the pages of CABLE #13 and X-FORCE #14!\r<br>One-Shot/Rated T+ …$3.99\r<br>",
