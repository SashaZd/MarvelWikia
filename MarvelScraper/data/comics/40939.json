    "description": "X-Force exists to tackle the problems ordinary X-Men canâ€™t or wonâ€™t confront â€” with extreme prejudice. But as the killing begins to take its toll, a less existential crisis faces the team: a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants â€” led by Wolverineâ€™s twisted son, Daken. With Fantomex already dead and the rest of X-Force lost in time, the Brotherhood begins its true quest: the kidnapping of Genesis, the young clone of Apocalypse, from Wolverineâ€™s Jean Grey School and the fulfillment of his destiny to rise as a mutant despot. The only way X-Force can save Genesis from the Brotherhood â€” and the world from a new Apocalypse â€” is a desperate assault on the Brotherhoodâ€™s base. But thatâ€™s just what Dakenâ€™s counting on! Collecting UNCANNY X-FORCE (2010) #30-35, and material from WOLVERINE: DANGEROUS GAMES and DEADPOOL (2008) #1000.",
