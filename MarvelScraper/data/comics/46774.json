    "description": "The FALL OF THE MUTANTS continues as the members of X-Factor — the original X-Men — face tragedies of their own! Angel is dead, apparently by suicide. The Beast is slowly losing his amazing intellect. Iceman’s powers are out of control. Cyclops and Marvel Girl don’t know how to feel toward one another. And amid all this, a new generation of troubled mutant teens desperately needs help — especially when they’re targeted by the villainous Right! And if that’s not enough, X-Factor faces their deadliest challenge yet in Apocalypse and his Horsemen — including the new Archangel! Guest-starring Captain America, Daredevil, the Hulk, the Fantastic Four and Power Pack!
