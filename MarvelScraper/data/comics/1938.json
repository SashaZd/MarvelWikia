    "description": "The X-Man known as Nightcrawler is a man with a foot in two worlds – one the daylight world of super heroes and super-villains; the other a netherworld of demons and angels, ghosts and monsters…human and otherwise. With the looks of a devil and the soul of a kind, ordinary man, Nightcrawler is used to being pulled in both directions, but now he might be asked to go where the other X-Men won’t – into the shadows that have always called to him! Does he have what it takes to get to the bottom of the strange deaths of thirteen children – and more important, is he strong enough to take on the sinister forces behind it once he does? \r<br>Collects NIGHTCRAWLER#1-6.\r<br>144 PGS./Marvel PSR …$14.99\r<br>",
