    "description": "It’s the final of three interlinking standalone stories, in CRIMINAL’s new expanded format!\r<br>\r<br>“*Female of the Species*” is the final piece to the noir puzzle of these three stories of crime and murder in the early 1970s. Told from the sympathetic POV of a Femme Fatale on her path to one final score and the revenge she’s been waiting years to get. A heartbreaking look into the other side of a noir tradition.\r<br>And on top of this longer-than-usual length main story, CRIMINAL now features an *expanded* back-pages section, as well – with articles by Brubaker and other top crime writers, from novelists to screenwriters to comic writers. These noir articles have become a popular piece of the CRIMINAL package, and are something that can only be found in the comics, not in any collections. So don’t miss out on this *standalone* issue of the most acclaimed crime comic on the stands!\r<br>\r<br>Mature Content/No Ads... $3.50\r<br>",
