    "description": "\"Memories of the Monster\"\r<br>By now you know that Lucas Bishop—former cop, renegade X-Man—refuses to rest until he's killed the so-called \"mutant messiah.\"  But do you know why?  To answer that question you have to look into Bishop's past…which actually means jumping 50 years into the future, when his parents barely escaped a nuclear holocaust, only to land in the most brutal \"mutant relocation\" camp in the world.  There, a young Bishop first heard the horror stories about the green-eyed monster that ushered in the the downfall of mutantkind, and swore vengeance -- embarking on a life-long, time-hopping mission that begins here, in this special three-part mini-series.  You haven't heard the \"Messiah Complex\" story until you've heard Bishop's side of the story…\r<br>Rated T+… $3.99\r<br>",
