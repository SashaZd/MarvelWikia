First, Spider-Man teams with the Red Hulk to face down a Moloid army during the New York Marathon! The two unlikely allies end up leading an underground legion — but when Red Hulk falls, only Spider-Man stands in the way of the Subterranean invasion of Manhattan! Then, Wells and Madureira turn their attention to the X-Men’s most popular mutant: the savage Wolverine! But what unlikely foe is lurking in the shadows, and does even Wolverine have the berserker strength to win the day? Wolverine slices and special guest-star Elektra dices — what more could you want in a comic? Collecting AVENGING SPIDER-MAN #1-3 and SAVAGE WOLVERINE #6-8.",
