His god anyway.  Khonshu -- God of the Moon, God of Vengeance -- saved Spector’s life, brought him to glory, made him a hero.  Made him Moon Knight.  But what Khonshu gives, he also takes away.  And once he takes, he takes for good.   Spector learned this the hard way, spiraling into madness, depression and worse.  But he also remembers.  Remembers what it felt like to jump off the top of a six-story tenement, cloak spread behind him.  Remembers the feel of cartilage and bone exploding beneath his fists. Remembers the fun stuff.  Now Specter wants back in the game.  Will Khonshu hear his prayer?\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>32 PGS./Rated T+ SUGGESTED FOR TEENS AND UP …$2.99\r<br>"
