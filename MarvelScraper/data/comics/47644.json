Then, on the run from Gamma Base, the Hulk finds himself used as a gamma-irradiated battery by new foe Goldbug and old nemesis Tyrannus! Plus: The Hulk is enraged to learn Gamma Base has the remains of his departed love Jarella — and no one, not even the visiting Captain Mar-Vell, will stop him from giving her a proper burial.

Collecting INCREDIBLE HULK (1968) #226-248 and ANNUAL #7-9, and CAPTAIN AMERICA (1968) #230.",
