    "description": "Fury and his small crew are trapped in a mansion, stuck babysitting captured German officers while enemy infantry closes in. To confuse matters further, their assassination target, German General Barkhorn, will need their protection if the captured Colonel Von Stehle is telling the truth about Barkhorn’s secret conspiracy to remove Adolph Hitler from power.  Can the commandos trust Von Stehle? They have a difficult decision ahead of them, and at stake is the conceivable end of World War II. But Fury and his comrades had better make up their minds quickly, because there’s a tank on the front lawn and it’s about to blow them to smithereens! \r<br>32 PGS./Rated T+ ...$3.50\r<br>",
