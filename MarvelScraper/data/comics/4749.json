    "description": "There is an order to everything. A balance to the world and the nether-realms beneath the world. And now that balance is being tipped, as dark forces gather like a storm. The occult mutants known as Salem’s Seven are once more banding together. But this time, it’s to bring their father, the nefarious Nicholas Scratch, back to life. If they should somehow succeed...pray for the Fantastic Four’s souls! Plus: An employee from Fantastic Enterprises comes to Sue for help, claiming that her son is being abused; meanwhile, Reed is asked to keep a promise he made to a dying man months ago. And finally, Fantastic Enterprises is ready to go public, and to mark the occasion the FF agrees to an outrageous publicity stunt: Drafting an honorary fifth member to join their team. Ten young super-heroes “compete” for the spot, but only nine of them have honorable intentions. Unlucky Number Ten will stop at nothing to win – and to get his or her hands on the secrets of the Fantastic Four! \r<br>Collects FOUR #25-30.\r<br>144 PGS./Rated T+ ...$14.99\r<br>",
