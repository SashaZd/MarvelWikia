    "description": "Tony Stark is back on his feet with Stark Resilient, a new company dedicated to bringing free, clean energy to the world — and that's just the start. But that kind of bold move naturally attracts enemies — and with a spy planted in his company by rival Justine Hammer, Tony can't afford to make any mistakes. Unfortunately, distractions abound — including a left-wing anarchist cult's theft of Stark technology and the Mandarin's omnipresent shadow — and Tony faces long odds to keep from making those mistakes. Does the corporate saboteur have him right where he wants him? Collecting INVINCIBLE IRON MAN #500, 500.1, ANNUAL #1 and material from #503.",
