The Uncanny X-Men have seen what can happen with no control over their powers. It cannot happen again. One mutant learns that once you leave the X-Men, the real world can be a punishing place. Another learns just what it means to be an X-Man. But what, exactly, are they being trained for? Plus: Cyclops and Magneto finally have it out! And which other former ally has signed up with S.H.I.E.L.D. to keep tabs on the X-Men? Collecting ",
