    "description": "Extreme times call for extreme measures. They are the X-Men’s special black-ops strike team, created to go places and do things the regular squad can’t or won’t. The members? The best trackers and killers the X-Men have to offer: Wolverine, X-23, Warpath and Wolfsbane. Their name? X-Force. When the bloodthirsty, mutant-hating religious sect known as the Purifiers rears its head, the members of X-Force launch themselves into battle with claws out and teeth bared. But the team’s plan is thrown into disarray when the Purifiers get their hands on Wolfsbane. X-Force must make moves to rescue their teammate and put down the Purifiers permanently. Then, the squad is catapulted into action when the lethal Legacy Virus goes missing, threatening the lives of every mutant on the planet. Wolverine and the young X-23 must attempt to hold the team together as the brutal, damaged histories of Wolfsbane and Archangel threaten to tear everything apart, starting with each other. Collecting X-FORCE #1-11.\r\nParental Advisory …$34.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4323-9\r\nTrim size: oversized",
