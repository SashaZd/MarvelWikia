    "description": "Celebrating 65 years of Captain America, we bring you an extra-long special that weaves together Cap’s modern stories with his fighting days in World War Two!  Cap’s newest enemy, General Aleksander Lukin, the head of one of the most powerful corporations in the world, is attempting to buy a piece of land in Germany, and he won’t take no for an answer. What does he want there? The answer to that can only be found in an untold tale from the war -- a story that finds Cap and Bucky fighting alongside Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos behind enemy lines, trying to stop the Red Skull from launching a monstrous attack on the Allies unlike anything ever seen before. This dynamite, down-and-dirty WW2-era special also ties directly into the current CAPTAIN AMERICA series, so Cap fans won’t want to miss it! From acclaimed creators Ed Brubaker and Eric Wight (The Escapist, The OC).\r<br>48 PGS./T+ SUGGESTED FOR TEENS AND UP ...$3.99\r<br>",
