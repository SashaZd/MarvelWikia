    "description": "AVX tie-in! When the cosmic Phoenix Force threatens the planet, it’s up to Earth’s Mightiest Heroes to stop it — but the X-Men have a different plan. The struggle between the two teams becomes a battle unlike any the Avengers have ever faced — and every Avenger will be challenged like never before. For Captain America, an encounter with A.I.M. could provide a win he sorely needs, even if the accompanying morale boost proves to be tragically short-lived. For Red Hulk, following his brilliant strategic instincts against his team’s wishes could prove to be a miscalculation — one that could cost him his life. For Wolverine, taking sides means fighting old friends and recruiting an unlikely ally. And for one Avenger, the war against the Phoenix will lead to betrayal! Collecting AVENGERS (2010) #25-30.",
