To kidnap the Master of Kung Fu and return him to his father, a man of consummate evil who has perpetuated his brand of wickedness and corruption for more than three thousand years, rumored to be alive again and bent on restoring his demonic legacy. Former Captain America Steve Rogers and his covert squad of Secret Avengers move in to save Shang-Chi and secure the mystical Eyes of the Dragon — along the way reuniting with an old friend from Steve's World War II days, but also finding themselves fighting on the opposite side of one another.
