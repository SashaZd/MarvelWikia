    "description": "Man, Thor, Giant-Man and the Wasp with a trio of former super villains, readers thought he’d gone mad. As it turned out, the only thing crazy about the adventures of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes was how insanely exciting the lineup of Captain America, Hawkeye, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch became! With super-sized conflict within the team and colossal menaces without, the drama made every issue a nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat extravaganza. Classic stories including battles with Kang the Conqueror, Doctor Doom, Power Man and the Enchantress, and Attuma will prove that the Avengers are the world’s preeminent heroes — while revelations like Captain America’s departure will test the team at its most fundamental level. But it won’t just be Cap’s Kooky Quartet against the world forever. In these pages, you’ll see also the return of Giant-Man and the Wasp, and Hank Pym’s transformation into Goliath! And with the first appearances of the Collector, the Swordsman and the Sons of the Serpent — not to mention the entrance of the Black Widow into the Avengers’ world — there’s no questioning this collection’s a MARVEL MASTERWORKS!
