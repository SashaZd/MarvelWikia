Plus: Ever wonder what the super-hero equivalent of a terrible soul-sucking talent-wasting temp job is? Wonder what Tommy (a.k.a. Speed) has been up to? Wonder why mutant David Alleyne (a.k.a. Prodigy) hasn’t been even in the background in any one of the eight thousand X-books? Discover answers herein! And hey, are you ready for Mother’s Day? Collecting YOUNG AVENGERS (2013) #6-10.",
