But when the mysterious “Icepick Protocol,” suddenly strikes at her beloved father figure, the stakes of Natalia’s dangerous work become even higher. With this mysterious conspiracy threatening everyone she loves, the Black Widow must untangle the decades of treachery and betrayal that have plagued her life since childhood.
