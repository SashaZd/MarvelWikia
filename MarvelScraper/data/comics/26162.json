    "description": "What do pencils, a feather duster and a plastic trash-bag have in common?  To stop a murderous snuff film ring, Frank Castle has to infiltrate a building with a security system so tight that he can’t bring in any weapons.  Nothing.  Nada.  Just his own wits, inventiveness and ruthless efficiency.  Oh, and a few cleaning products and office supplies. It’s the Punisher at his ruthless best; as you’ve never seen him before -- the bad guys won’t know what hit them. Multiple Bram Stoker Award-winning author Jonathan Maberry (Patient Zero) takes the Punisher into dark territory in this stand-alone tale.\r\nOne-Shot/Explicit Content …$3.99",
