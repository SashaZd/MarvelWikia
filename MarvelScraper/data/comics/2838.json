    "description": "The second of two SUPREME POWER specials! As a young boy, Kyle Richmond—the man who would one day become Nighthawk—witnessed the senseless murder of his parents. There was no reason for their deaths, no provocation -- they were just simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was a traumatic event that has left him scarred for life—and turned him into a hero more feared than the criminals he polices.  Now it’s happening again...but on a much larger scale.  The people of Chicago—men, women and children—are dying in the streets, victims of a monster whose thirst for slaughter cannot be quenched, whose soul is a bottomless void, and whose scars run even deeper than Nighthawk’s.  Long ago, Kyle Richmond looked into the face of madness—now, it’s looking back at him.  And it’s flashing a killer smile.\r<br>\r<br>32 PGS./ EXPLICIT CONTENT …$2.99\r<br>",
