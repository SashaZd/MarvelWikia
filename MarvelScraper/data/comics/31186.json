And then he wakes up in a hospital room…the doctors inform him that he’s been in a car accident…and they can’t treat him. Because he’s a robot. Specifically, Garson is an Electric Ant, a human-like robot created and programmed to serve a specific function. But what is Garson’s function? How will his friends and co-workers treat him,\r\nknowing that he’s a machine, and not a person? And how much of his world is real, and how much of it is part of his\r\nprogramming? Written by Kabuki scribe David Mack and illustrated by Pascal Alixe (ETERNALS ANNUAL).\r\nMature …$3.99\r\n© and TM 2010 Laura Leslie, Isa Dick Hackett and Christopher Dick",
