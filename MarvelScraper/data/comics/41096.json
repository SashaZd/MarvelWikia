And as if all that weren’t enough, Havok and his new Brotherhood have offered Nate a place in their ranks — but their roster includes fellow AoA refugee the Dark Beast, and they plan to take over the world! In the face of all this adversity, what’s an unbelievably powerful psionic mutant to do? Guest-starring Bishop, Cyclops, Phoenix and more! Collecting X-MAN #20-29 and ANNUAL ’96, and AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (1963) #420.",
