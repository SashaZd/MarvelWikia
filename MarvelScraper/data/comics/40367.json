    "description": "X-Factor has suffered its greatest casualty yet: Madrox, the man of many multiples who&rsquo;s led the team since its inception, is gone. It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be this way, but only Layla Miller knows why &mdash; and the secret she&rsquo;s keeping goes to the heart of her powers and purpose with X-Factor. With their fearless leader dead, and the schism between Wolverine and Cyclops ripping the mutant world apart, X-Factor&rsquo;s future is uncertain. That&rsquo;s why Wolverine has paid the team a visit, offering a shocking new option for the world&rsquo;s only mutant detective agency. It&rsquo;s two for the price of one as Havok and Polaris return from exile to take charge of X-Factor Investigations! But is Madrox really dead? Even Jamie isn&rsquo;t sure!
