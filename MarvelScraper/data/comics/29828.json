Funny thing is, he was hiding in plain sight  there in the glare of the white hot lights, a lanky stranger with the rubber arm, throwing heat that could take off a manâ€™s head. See, every man needs a challenge, a moment when he faces impossible odds, when looks deep inside himself and sees what heâ€™s really made of.
