    "description": "The Age of Apocalypse’s Nightcrawler wants to get home — and he doesn’t care whether he destroys our world to get there! When he betrays X-Force, Wolverine sees red and calls in his street team, but can do what’s necessary to stop him? Meanwhile, Dazzler’s X-Treme X-Men scramble to repair a tear between dimensions! As the multiverse is slowly consumed, no one is safe — and the heroes must split up to fight a war in two universes. But as the rift continues widening, the only chance might be to step into the void! Wolverine battles Wolverine, the X-Treme X-Men’s Kid Nightcrawler makes the ultimate sacrifice, and Wolverine must say a final goodbye to the AoA’s Jean Grey! Collecting X-TREME X-MEN (2012) #12-13, AGE OF APOCALYPSE #13-14, X-TERMINATION #1-2 and ASTONISHING X-MEN (2004) #60-61.",
