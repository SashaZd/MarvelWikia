The gangsters and hoods with old axes to grind -- them you expected, but not this guy: Someone who knows you, someone who wants your undivided attention and is willing to do anything to get it.  And certainly not the fugitive Captain America, who shows up at your doorstep, wanting a word.  Maybe he thinks he can harness all your excess energy into something useful...something that can aid him in his grudge match with Tony Stark in the CIVIL WAR tearing through the Marvel U?  Maybe this war is worth winning at any cost?  And you get to thinking... \r<br>32 PGS./Parental Advisory ...$2.99\r<br>",
