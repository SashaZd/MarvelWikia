    "description": "Mike Deodato made a big splash during the mid-'90s with a style combining a solid grasp of anatomy; layouts bristling with dynamic energy; and a brash, trendsetting dynamism that set him apart as a visionary Marvel could build around for the rest of the decade and beyond. With his startling work on Warren Ellis' THOR setting the pace, Deodato's later triumphs on INCREDIBLE HULK, AMAZING SPIDER-MAN and THUNDERBOLTS set the stage for his jaw-dropping visuals on DARK AVENGERS - where the stark, moody character of his work was a perfect match for writer Brian Michael Bendis' deconstruction of Norman Osborn's sanity. THE MARVEL ART OF MIKE DEODATO celebrates the vibrant and vital career of one of comics' elite artists with a bounty of interior and cover art, character sketches, and unpublished work. Featuring commentary from many of Mike's industry peers as well as the artist himself! ",
