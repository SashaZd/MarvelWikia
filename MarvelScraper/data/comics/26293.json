    "description": "In a world where no one can be trusted, only one man can hope to stand against tyranny: Nick Fury! Fury — former director of S.H.I.E.L.D, the now defunct world peacekeeping organization — has gathered a special team of handpicked soldiers to help defend the cause of justice. But his Secret Warriors — young, inexperienced super heroes known only to Fury — have a lot to learn and a short time to learn it. And with the ruthless Hydra on their heels, their every mistake may have fatal consequences. Their covert mission will take the Secret Warriors around the globe; along the way, they’ll uncover a conspiracy that reaches from the Oval Office to the temples of Japan, and even beyond death. Fury has known for years that no one is outside Hydra’s reach, but even he never anticipated that their treachery might extend to S.H.I.E.L.D itself. Collecting SECRET WARRIORS #1-6 and material from DARK REIGN NEW NATION.\r\nRated T  …$19.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-3864-8",
