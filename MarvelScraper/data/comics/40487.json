Tony Stark intercepts a signal that may lead the Avengers into the arms of one of their dearest friends — or their greatest enemies. Two classic Avengers return for the first time in years as a giant status-quo shift looms on the horizon. Earth’s Mightiest Heroes must come to terms with themselves as a team and a family, but does this modern world really need the Avengers? One of the most controversial and spectacular eras of the Avengers comes to a spectacular and controversial conclusion! Plus: Wonder Man doesn’t think the Avengers are helping the world, and he’s willing to do whatever is needed to stop them —. even forming his own team, the Revengers! Collecting AVENGERS (2010) #31-34, NEW AVENGERS ANNUAL (2011) #1 and AVENGERS ANNUAL (2012) #1.",
