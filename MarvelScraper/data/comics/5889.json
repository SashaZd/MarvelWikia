    "description": "Ptolus: The City By the Spire is a place of history and mystery, a city built upon the ruins of itself, and filled with adventures from top to bottom. And Sheva Callister, a retired treasure hunter who’s come back for one last job, is painfully aware of this as she stumbles into the underground tomb of Narros, the Lich King, a powerful undead creature who does not appreciate her intrusion. But if she and her companions can escape, they’ll only be plunged into more excitement and deception as various nobles from the city above use her in a pawn in a strange game of their own. That is, of course, unless the legendary “Iron Mage” appears and lends her a hand…\r<br>Penned by Monte Cook, one of the best-known contributors to the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS third edition and the creator of the PTOLUS campaign set (described as “the most deluxe campaign set ever made!”), this comic book miniseries has turned heads for its sharp writing and its beautiful artistic style. It’s a must have for any fantasy fan, and a great read for anyone who enjoys a good adventure!\r<br>32 PGS./Rated T+ …$2.99\r<br>",
