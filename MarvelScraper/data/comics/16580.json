This is one private investigator/assassin who’s seen and done a lot in his 1,500+ years of life, but the mess he’s in now is new to him–someone’s made off with his left arm, the enchanted arm of his true love that houses both the curse that keeps him alive, and the soul that keeps him good. As he loses control of his darker impulses, it’s only a matter of time until he literally falls to pieces…but someone won’t even let him live that long! Now it’s a race against the rapidly decomposing clock to find the arm, the people who took it…and the people trying to kill him!
