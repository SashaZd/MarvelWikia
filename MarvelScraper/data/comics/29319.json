    "description": "As a costumed adventurer, Jessica Jones was plagued by a lack of self-esteem and an inability to master her superhuman powers. She hung up her cape and tights when she realized she would forever be considered a second-rate super hero. Now a tough-as-nails private investigator, Jessica returns home to find a mysterious girl in a costume hiding in her apartment, but she flies away before Jessica can find out who she is. Through sources, Jessica discovers that her intruder is Mattie Franklin, a.k.a. Spider-Woman, a teenage super hero with a connection to Daily Bugle publisher J. Jonah Jameson. With Mattie in danger, Jessica Jones must seek help from an unlikely source — Jessica Drew, the original Spider-Woman — to bring her home alive. Then, for the first time, learn all of Jessica’s hidden secrets — how she got her powers and joined the Avengers, and the dark, unspoken chapter in Marvel Universe history that changed her life forever. Guest-starring Peter Parker, Jean Grey and the Avengers! Collecting ALIAS #16-28.\r\nParental Advisory …$34.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-4490-8",
