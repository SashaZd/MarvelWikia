Teenage outcast and king of the wallflowers, Peter Parker, may have the most amazing powers in the super-hero biz, but good luck coming up with more downsides than this cat. Not only does his boss, J. Jonah Jameson consider him Public Enemy #1, he’s sending not just one, but two villains after him—Mac Gargan, the Scorpion, and the vicious Spider-Slayer. And to add insult to injury, the Human Torch one-ups him against the Beetle and the Circus of Crime offers a whole host of reasons to hate peanuts. After that anybody’d need therapy, so Spidey hits the couch, and the couch hits right back with a mysterious foe that’s going to give Parker’s complexes complexes! To make matters worse, the Green Goblin teams up with the Crime-Master, Aunt May finds a certain red and blue costume, and the Molten Man makes high school graduation a day to remember in Forest Hills, Queens. Top that off with a classic team-up between Lee and Ditko’s greatest creations, Spidey and Dr. Strange, and you’ve got yourself a cover-to-cover classic!
