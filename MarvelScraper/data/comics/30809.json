    "description": "St. Louis&rsquo; future hangs in the balance when master vampires Alejandro and Jean-Claude pit their dark forces against each other in a battle for control of the city&rsquo;s vampires! Only Anita Blake holds the key to turning the tide of this war, but can either vampire leader be trusted not to make her a slave of desire? And that&rsquo;s just her day job. Anita gets back in the game when she agrees to a date with science teacher Richard Zeeman, but this seemingly normal hunk is conspicuously cool with the dangers of Anita&rsquo;s profession and the horrific exploits of her associates like Jean-Claude. Will sparks fly, or is this regular guy too good to be true? Collecting ANITA BLAKE: CIRCUS OF THE DAMNED &mdash; THE SCOUNDREL #1-5.",
