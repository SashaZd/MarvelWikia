But when the Cat gets her paws on a stolen tablet the Kingpin desperately wants, the crime lord hires the deadly Elektra to retrieve it! Plus: A new villain explodes on the scene — literally! But how can Spider-Man fight the mysterious Geldoff if he can’t even find a costume? And will Peter and Mary Jane finally just say what they feel?! Guest-starring the Ultimate X-Men! Collecting ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN (2000) #40-45 and #47-53.",
