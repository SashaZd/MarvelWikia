    "description": "“THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK” \r\nYou’ve seen Deadpool in countless (and we mean countless) comics before — but never like this. Really.  Want answers about Deadpool?  Like why does he refuse to remove his weird red-and-black mask? Why does he only answer to the name “Deadpool?”  Was he really part of a black bag special ops team that nobody has ever heard of?  Were his teammates really given names like “Bulllseye,” “Silver Sable” and “Domino”?  What did Wilson know, and when did he know it? A bloody massacre in Sinaloa, Mexico has left hundreds dead and disgraced soldier Wade Wilson has a LOT of explaining to do. \r\nParental Advisory …$3.99",
