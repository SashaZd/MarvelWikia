    "description": "The Halo saga begins here! First, the enhanced super-soldier Master Chief takes on the Covenant’s miles-long command craft — heading for Earth to activate the world-shattering Halo weapon. It’s time to lock, load and save billions of people — or die trying. Then, Helljumpers are the meanest, most battled-hardened Marines in the UNSC. But even the Helljumpers are taken aback when they respond to a remote science colony’s SOS call and discover an enormous Covenant military presence! Finally, a UNSC ship encounters a strange phenomenon that sends it plummeting toward an unknown planet. But they’re not the only ones shipwrecked there! Be there as the Halo saga unfolds — with all-new stories set in the world of Bungee’s blockbuster Halo videogame series! Collecting HALO: UPRISING #1-4, BLOOD LINE #1-5 and HELLJUMPER #1-5.",
