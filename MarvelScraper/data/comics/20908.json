    "description": "It’s the second of three standalone stories, as CRIMINAL’s new expanded format keeps the hits coming!\r<br>\r<br>In previous arcs of Criminal we’ve met the man who killed him, and we met his only surviving son… now meet TEEG LAWLESS, thief, murderer, and all around bad mother-#@$%er. Fresh from two tours in Vietnam, Teeg arrives home in 1972 carrying the baggage of war, a drug habit, and an unpaid debt to a local mob boss that’s now long overdue. *“Before the Living End”* tells how he goes about finding a way out of his problems and back into the life of crime.\r<br>\r<br>And on top of this longer-than-usual length main story, CRIMINAL now features an *expanded* back-pages section, as well – with articles by Brubaker and other top crime writers, from novelists to screenwriters to comic writers. These noir articles have become a popular piece of the CRIMINAL package, and are something that can only be found in the comics, not in any collections.\r<br>So don’t miss out on this second *standalone* issue of the most acclaimed crime comic on the stands!\r<br>Mature Content/No Ads... $3.50",
