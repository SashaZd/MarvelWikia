    "description": "In August 1939 a new voice hit the newsstands and changed the comic-book world forever: MARVEL COMICS #1, with its blazing Human Torch cover, had arrived! And this 64-page pulp package wasn’t your typical assortment of super-powered, straight-laced, do-gooders—this was something completely new. The amazing android creation of Dr. Phineas Horton, the Human Torch was neither man nor hero—he was a blazing force of nature that shocked and unsettled mankind. Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner, the half-human/half-Atlantean, ventures from his undersea kingdom into the world of man—not with a mind set on peace, but towards vengeance! These two characters would form the foundation for the style of conflicted hero that defines Marvel to this day, and you’ll see them evolve across twelve full issues from their raw forms into the battling fire and water mega-hits of the Golden Age! They’re flanked by an eclectic set born out of the fast-paced energy and imagination of the Golden Age including the heroic Angel; the wild and incomparable robot invention, Electro; the hard-edged detective, the Ferret; Terry Vance, the boy adventurer; the Western Masked Raider; and the ongoing jungle adventures of Ka-Zar, the Great. Featuring an extensive essay on Marvel’s pulp magazine pre-history, publisher Martin Goodman and the birth of Marvel Comics by noted historian Will Murray, and topped off with special bonus features including original artwork and items never seen since 1939, this collection forms the cornerstone of Marvel history essential for every comic book fan, collector and historian!
