Karen Grant and Ultimate X are on the run. Quicksilver has taken the offensive, brokering a deal with none other than the president. But when the world discovers the true history of the X-gene, the decades-old secret threatens to destabilize the planet — and the divide between mankind and mutantkind grows wider than ever before! It’s a brave, new world for the X-Men. Will they survive the opening salvo? Collecting ULTIMATE COMICS X-MEN (2011) #1-6.",
