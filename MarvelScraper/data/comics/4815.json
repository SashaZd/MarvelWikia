    "description": "“VICIOUS CYCLE” \r<br>Johnny Blaze has escaped from Hell--but unfortunately, he wasn’t alone: Lucifer has once again played Johnny for a fool and used him to hitch a ride onto the mortal plane.  The Ghost Rider must now track down Lucifer and send him back to where he came from before the Devil succeeds in creating a new Hell...here on earth. This is no small task, but it is further complicated by both the fact that Lucifer hides behind many faces and that there are those—one very strange man, in particular—who would prefer Ghost Rider cease his mission immediately...or else. Part 2 (of 6).\r<br>32 PGS./Rated T+ ...$2.99\r<br>",
