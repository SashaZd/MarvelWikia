When Spider-Man clashes with the Public Eye, he finds himself at a disadvantage — but is suddenly saved by the mysterious Thanatos. Has Downtown found a new hero, or does Thanatos have a more sinister agenda? And what is his connection to the mysterious Net Prophet, who arrives in 2099 through a portal from a strange and new universe? When Thanatos reveals his true colors, Spider-Man must battle for survival in a virtual unreality world! Plus: who is Mutagen, and why is he targeting people born with genetic impurities? And Miguel has his hands full when he battles a body-controlling virus, investigates a century-old Soviet submarine and faces the explosive Chernobyl! Collecting SPIDER-MAN 2099 #11-14 and ANNUAL #1, and material from 2099 UNLIMITED #1-3.",
