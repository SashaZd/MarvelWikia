    "description": "During a character-defining run, Brian Michael Bendis crafted a pulp-fiction narrative that exploited the Man Without Fear’s rich tapestry of characters and psychodrama, and resolved them in an incredibly nuanced, modern approach. Now, this Eisner award-winning run is collected across three titanic trade paperbacks! In this volume, Matt Murdock is forced to reckon with the problems and legal ramifications that have emerged as a result of his public outing. The last thing he needs is the return of Typhoid Mary—one of his deadliest foes, a schizophrenic predator who terrorizes her targets with a seemingly inexhaustible lust for bloodshed. But even worse is her connection to Wilson Fisk, who’s back in Hell’s Kitchen—attempting to restore his fallen empire and exact revenge against those who ousted him from his once untouchable position of Kingpin of Crime.\r\nRated T  …$34.99",
