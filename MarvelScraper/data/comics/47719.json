    "description": "They say you can never go home. For the Young Avengers, that’s not true. They can go home — it’s just that if they do, the universe may end. The team takes on the gig to save reality, but is Kate Bishop an enemy in waiting? Will Noh-Varr get an arrow through the head? And is this the end of the loveable/strangle-able Kid Loki? As the Young Avengers take on “the Young Avengers,” Loki’s scheme reaches its final twist — and the Young Avengers’ jaws hit the floor. Then, the team gathers in a nightclub for a string of connected and overlapping stories illustrated by an all-star cast of people we really like. And as the New Year looms, the Young Avengers get a resolution — and so do you. Plus: Kissing! Drama! Conflict! Kissing! Collecting YOUNG AVENGERS (2013) #11-15.",
