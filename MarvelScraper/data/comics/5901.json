    "description": "A man wakes up on a beach with no memory of who he is and no clues about his identity, save a mysterious tattoo that simply says, “XIII.” But when XIII is attacked by two would-be killers determined to take him out, he dispatches them easily with reflexive military training, which helps him to realize that he is more than a simple man with amnesia. Now, XIII must uncover the secrets of his past and learn who he really is and what his mission was before he lost his memory. But along the way, he will learn that he may have been responsible for killing the President of the United States… and working for enemies who have intentions far beyond his simple quest to remember who he is. Europe’s bestselling, classic graphic novel series is finally available in the English language, and it’s sure to be a hit with anyone who enjoys great storytelling in the style of THE BOURNE IDENTITY. It’s also the basis of a critically-acclaimed video game by Ubisoft starring David Duchovny as Agent XIII! Be sure to pick it up while you can, but be warned – once you start to unravel the mysteries of XIII, you won’t want to stop until you reach the conclusion!\r<br>144 PGS./EXPLICIT CONTENT…$14.99 \r<br>",
