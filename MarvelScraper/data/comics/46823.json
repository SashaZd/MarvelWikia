There’s a serial killer tearing through London, leaving beautiful young women as his victims. Do these brutal slayings mark the return of the 19th-century serial killer known as Jack the Ripper? Or could one of the X-Men be the real killer?! Wolverine is the prime suspect — and Gambit is out to prove him guilty! Now they’re grudgingly forced to work together in order to find the truth — without killing each other! It’s a fast-paced murder mystery that will keep you guessing right up until the last page.
