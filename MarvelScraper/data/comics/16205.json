    "description": "How did Johnny Blaze end up in Hell, anyway? It’s simple, really: He died. And when he died, his eternal soul -- long promised to Hell in exchange for “saving” Crash Simpson -- descended into the Pit, taking the Ghost Rider along with it. This is the story of how and why it all happened, courtesy of writer Daniel Way and horror-comic legend Richard Corben. Plus: In a small town northeast of Chicago, people are losing their heads…literally. The sheriff of this sleepy little town firmly believes he’s found the culprit -- a scruffy drifter found sleeping in the bushes with blood on his clothes and no believable explanation for where he was and what he was doing when the murders occurred. He even gave the sheriff a fake name: “Johnny Blaze.”  But the identity of the true culprit is even more macabre: Lucifer has taken up residence in a new host -- a casualty of Civil War who’s bound to raise eyebrows! Collecting GHOST RIDER #6-11.\r<br>144 PGS./Rated T+ …$13.99 \r<br>",
