    "description": "Alan Moore and Alan Davis represent two of graphic storytelling’s greatest innovators. Individually, they are masters; together, they are legend. And for every legend, there is a beginning. For each, this is their first masterpiece, a fitting repository of the literary and artistic standards they would establish. A story that would influence the heart and soul of comic books for generations. For Brian Braddock, a.k.a. Captain Britain, it began when the Merlin of Arthurian myth transported him to a world sideways to his own, an alternate reality on the brink of annihilation. A world Braddock would fail to save. And when the events that destroyed that world begin to repeat themselves on his own, Captain Britain faces a destiny that he cannot avert. Join Moore and Davis in this collection of their first collaboration, originally published exclusively in Marvel’s United Kingdom line.\r<br>200 PGS./Marvel PSR …$19.95\r<br>",
