    "description": "Bruce Banner has only ever wanted one thing: to be at peace with the love of his life, Betty Ross. The legacy of the Incredible Hulk has long made this an impossible dream. But now, with the Intelligencia seemingly having restored Betty to life, Banner’s pursuit of her has never been more relentless -- or inconvenient. For after the Fall of the Hulks, with the master plan of the cunning Intelligencia hitting its every mark toward world domination and an army of Hulked-Out Heroes trashing the nation’s capital, the last thing his fellow fighters need to wonder about is Banner’s loyalty to them -- or Betty. And all the while, Skaar, Son of Hulk, waits for the moment he knows is coming: the emergence of the green-skinned Hulk -- so he can kill him and satisfy a lifelong quest for revenge! Collecting INCREDIBLE HULK #609-611 and INCREDIBLE HULK #312.",
