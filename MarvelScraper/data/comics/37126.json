Fail. Until now. Mazer Rackham has teamed up with the Mobile Operations Police, the super elite special forces unit that previously rejected him. Their plan? Destroy a formic lander. How? By going deep underground, down in the formic tunnels . . . where swarms of formics are ready and waiting. Will they turn the tide of war or dig their own graves? The exciting prequel to Ender's Game continues. From bestselling author and science-fiction legend Orson Scott Card.",
