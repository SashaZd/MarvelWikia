    "description": "Based at the new Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, Rogue leads a squad of veteran X-Men charged with teaching — and safeguarding — the next generation of mutants. But that proves to be no easy task when new threats emerge every day at the school, from the interdimensional demons known as the N’Garai to an out-of-control Weapon Omega. And the deadliest enemy of all may be the near-omnipotent mutant called Exodus, who blames Wolverine and his team for the schism that split the X-Men in two, and he’ll do everything in his vast power to reunite the species — including removing anyone who stands in his way. Collecting X-MEN LEGACY #260.1 and #261-265.",
