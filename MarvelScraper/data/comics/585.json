            "text": "\"THE SINGULARITY\" PART 1 (OF 4) AVENGERS DISASSEMBLED TIE-IN! Tony Stark cares too much, and that's always been his downfall. His concerns over the welfare of the world have led him to alcoholism, caused him to alienate himself from those he loves, and forced him to make decisions he never should have made. Now, disgraced before the United Nations and uncertain of his own stability, Tony Stark retreats into seclusion -- a ticking-time bomb of raw emotion.  And if he doesn't get it under control soon--he's gonna explode.  Meanwhile, Iron Man goes on a murderous rampage aimed at those in charge of Stark Enterprises!"
