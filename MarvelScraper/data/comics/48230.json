And why can’t he bring himself to leave? Ex-showgirl Suzie may have the answers, but is she more than she appears? And when Logan witnesses a crime in his own backyard, will this mystery drag him back into the world of high-stakes adventure whether he likes it or not? Under the control of an evil hypnotist, Logan learns new dark secrets from his past — and one of these secrets may lead him to kill again.
