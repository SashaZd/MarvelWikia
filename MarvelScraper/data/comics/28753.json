    "description": "The Civil War is over, and the Avengers are divided. Captain America’s death has been a blow to both sides. Now, the Star-Spangled Sentinel is back — and it could destroy the time stream! In AVENGERS/INVADERS, Alex Ross, Jim Krueger and Stephen Sadowski (Dynamite Entertainment’s Project: Superpowers) — along with artists Patrick Berkenkotter and Jackson Herbert — show what happens when the conflicted heroes of today’s Marvel Universe are faced with the return of the late hero who inspired them all. When World War II heroes Captain America, Namor, the Human Torch, Bucky, and Toro show up in modern-day New York City, both factions reveal their own agendas and goals for the heroes of the past. In AVENGERS/INVADERS, the heroes of today are taught lessons by heroes from the past in a time-slinging adventure that pits them against everyone from Ultron to The Red Skull. Collecting AVENGERS/INVADERS #1-12.\r\nRated T  …$34.99 \r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-2943-1",
