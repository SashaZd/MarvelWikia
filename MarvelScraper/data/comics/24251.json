Fear not hairless ones, because MARVEL APES are about to get HAMMERED!\r<br>When teenager Roy Reyna finds he can transform into the super-powered simian APE X, it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys…until H.A.M.M.E.R. agents capture him. The next thing Ape X knows, he's in a secret prison being interrogated about some strange…Ape Universe. He doesn't have the answers they want, and they don't believe him. But they'll break him, one way or another…\r<br>Ape X's only hope is Jane Potter— a young journalist working for the Front Line newspaper, hungry for her first Big Story— plus her quirky co-conspirators: the Initiative's furry fury, Gorilla Girl, and the world's most lovable loser, the Gibbon. All this banana bunch has to do to save Ape X is break into the secret government facility known as…PROJECT PEGASUS.\r<br>Mix in some bad puns and big guns, the Red Ghost's Super-Apes and a sinister cyber-simian called Ooktron, and the fur really flies! But escaping from Project Pegasus is no joke— and on this front line everyone is expendable!\r<br>One-Shot/Rated T+ …$3.99\r<br>",
