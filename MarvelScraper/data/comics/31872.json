    "description": "The prospecting vessel Long Time Coming is more than your average explorer ship. Underneath the grit and grime, it's part of the Office of Naval Intelligence, and its crew and \"prospecting equipment\" are en route to the front lines. That is, until the ship encounters a strange phenomenon in slipspace that sends the vessel plummeting toward an unknown planet. But they're not the only ones shipwrecked on this world — a world that's more than just an anonymous hunk of rock. Critically acclaimed comics scribe Fred Van Lente (INCREDIBLE HERCULES, X-MEN NOIR) teams with up-and-coming artist Francis Portela (BLACK PANTHER) to bring you HALO: BLOOD LINE — a story of war, survival and, above all else, a family of Spartans who will never let each other down. Collecting HALO: BLOOD LINE #1-5.",
