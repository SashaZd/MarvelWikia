    "description": "It’s the unstoppable Hulk vs. the unkillable Wolverine in the biggest fight the Ultimate Universe has ever witnessed! S.H.I.E.L.D. head Nick Fury thought he’d killed the Hulk’s alter ego, scientist Bruce Banner. But now, the tower of rage and green muscle is rampaging across the globe. Fury has a long list of operatives at his disposal. But there’s only one man capable of doing this job right: Wolverine! With razor-sharp claws, unbreakable Adamantium bones and a healing factor that can shrug off wounds that would kill lesser men, Logan seems the perfect match for the Hulk. But in their first encounter, the Hulk shows him the meaning of raw power — by ripping Wolverine in half! Can either man survive this fearsome reckoning? And if so, will they ever be the same again? Collecting ULTIMATE WOLVERINE VS. HULK #1-6.\r\nRated T  …$19.99",
