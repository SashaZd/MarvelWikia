    "description": "It’s a blast from the X-Men’s past! Professor X’s original five students — Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Angel and Beast — are plucked from the past and brought to the present. But what they find — the state of their future selves, and the state of Xavier’s dream — is far from the future they dreamed of. How will these young, idealistic heroes react when faced with the crushing knowledge of what their future holds? And how will the embittered X-Men of the present deal with their past coming crashing forward? When the original team comes face to face with their counterparts, it isn’t a peaceful meeting — and one of the X-Men will be forever changed. Brian Michael Bendis and Stuart Immonen blaze a new trail for the X-Men! Collecting ALL-\nNEW X-MEN #1-5.\n",
