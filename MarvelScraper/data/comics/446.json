In a saga of courage, adversity, revenge and brotherhood, Thor faces perils that will challenge his mettle as a young warrior, and trials that will test and temper his immortal spirit. Sent on a Great Quest by All-Father Odin, Thor and a fellowship of other young godlings – Balder, Sif and Loki – face their coming of age in this epic story written by celebrated manga writer Akira Yoshida and beautifully illustrated by newcomer Greg Tocchini.
