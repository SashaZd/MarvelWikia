    "description": "Orbital Drop Shock Troopers from the 105th Division—more famously known as the “Helljumpers”—have arrived at a distressed science colony on the planet Ariel…only problem? The place is totally abandoned. As the Helljumpers investigate, trying to figure out what happened to the colonists, it becomes increasingly clear that the colony isn’t quite as empty as it seemed… the discovery of a large Covenant military presence raises more questions than it answers. Helljumpers Dutch and Romeo have penetrated farthest into the Covenant-held facility, and when all hell breaks loose, it will be the ultimate test of their fighting prowess—and their friendship.\r\nCardstock Cover/17 & Up …$3.99",
